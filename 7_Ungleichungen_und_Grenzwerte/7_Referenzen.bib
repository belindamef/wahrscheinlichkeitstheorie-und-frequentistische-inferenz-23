	abstract = {Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suffer from low power, and especially for published fMRI experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true effect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically significant result indicates a true effect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, findings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a fMRI study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Specifically, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average effect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an fMRI experiment, while preserving a predefined statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.},

	abstract = {The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {A wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this “methodological plurality” comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publicly shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL, and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyse, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. Qualitatively we find similarities between packages, backed up by Neurosynth association analyses that correlate similar words and phrases to all three software package's unthresholded results for each of the studies we reanalyse. However, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 to 0.684 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our efforts to make this research reproducible.},

Over the last few years, internet-based technologies have emerged that allow for a representation of the scientific process that goes far beyond traditional methods and analysis descriptions. Using these often freely available tools requires a suite of skills that is not necessarily part of a curriculum in the life sciences. However, funders, journals, and policy makers increasingly require researchers to ensure complete reproducibility of their methods and analyses. To close this gap, we designed an introductory course that guides students towards a reproducible science workflow. Here, we outline the course content and possible extensions, report encountered challenges, and discuss how to integrate such a course in existing curricula.},

	abstract = {The growth of data sharing initiatives for neuroimaging and genomics represents an exciting opportunity to confront the “small N” problem that plagues contemporary neuroimaging studies while further understanding the role genetic markers play in the function of the brain. When it is possible, open data sharing provides the most beneﬁts. However, some data cannot be shared at all due to privacy concerns and/or risk of re-identiﬁcation. Sharing other data sets is hampered by the proliferation of complex data use agreements (DUAs) which preclude truly automated data mining. These DUAs arise because of concerns about the privacy and conﬁdentiality for subjects; though many do permit direct access to data, they often require a cumbersome approval process that can take months. An alternative approach is to only share data derivatives such as statistical summaries—the challenges here are to reformulate computational methods to quantify the privacy risks associated with sharing the results of those computations. For example, a derived map of gray matter is often as identiﬁable as a ﬁngerprint. Thus alternative approaches to accessing data are needed. This paper reviews the relevant literature on differential privacy, a framework for measuring and tracking privacy loss in these settings, and demonstrates the feasibility of using this framework to calculate statistics on data distributed at many sites while still providing privacy.},

	abstract = {Crisis of replicability is one term that psychological scientists use for the current introspective phase we are in—I argue instead that we are going through a revolution analogous to a political revolution. Revolution 2.0 is an uprising focused on how we should be doing science now (i.e., in a 2.0 world). The precipitating events of the revolution have already been well-documented: failures to replicate, questionable research practices, fraud, etc. And the fact that none of these events is new to our field has also been well-documented. I suggest four interconnected reasons as to why this time is different: changing technology, changing demographics of researchers, limited resources, and misaligned incentives. I then describe two reasons why the revolution is more likely to catch on this time: technology (as part of the solution) and the fact that these concerns cut across social and life sciences—that is, we are not alone. Neither side in the revolution has behaved well, and each has characterized the other in extreme terms (although, of course, each has had a few extreme actors). Some suggested reforms are already taking hold (e.g., journals asking for more transparency in methods and analysis decisions; journals publishing replications) but the feared tyrannical requirements have, of course, not taken root (e.g., few journals require open data; there is no ban on exploratory analyses). Still, we have not yet made needed advances in the ways in which we accumulate, connect, and extract conclusions from our aggregated research. However, we are now ready to move forward by adopting incremental changes and by acknowledging the multiplicity of goals within psychological science.},

Sparked by the analysis of resting-state fMRI data, there has recently been a resurgence of interest in the validity of some of the p-values evaluated with the widely used software SPM. The default parametric p-values reported in SPM are based on the application of results from random ﬁeld theory to statistical parametric maps, a framework we refer to as RFP. While RFP was established almost two decades ago and has since been applied in a plethora of fMRI studies, there does not exist a uniﬁed documentation of the mathematical and computational underpinnings of RFP as implemented in current versions of SPM. Here, we provide such a documentation with the aim of contributing to contemporary eﬀorts towards higher levels of computational transparency in functional neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in deep neural networks have led to effective vision-based reinforcement learning methods that have been employed to obtain human-level controllers in Atari 2600 games from pixel data. Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the ﬁrstperson perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical ﬁrst-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results conﬁrm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic ﬁrst-person perspective environments is feasible.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) theory suggests two classes of algorithms solving this credit assignment problem: In classic temporal-difference learning, earlier actions receive reward information only after multiple repetitions of the task, whereas models with eligibility traces reinforce entire sequences of actions from a single experience (one-shot). Here, we show one-shot learning of sequences. We developed a novel paradigm to directly observe which actions and states along a multi-step sequence are reinforced after a single reward. By focusing our analysis on those states for which RL with and without eligibility trace make qualitatively distinct predictions, we find direct behavioral (choice probability) and physiological (pupil dilation) signatures of reinforcement learning with eligibility trace across multiple sensory modalities.},

In general, statistical power and sample size calculations are dependent on the statistical inference framework that is used to test hypotheses. Bibliometric analyses suggest that random  eld theory (RFT)-based voxel- and cluster-level fMRI inference are the most commonly used approaches for the statistical evaluation of task-related fMRI data. However, general power and sample size calculations for these inference approaches remain elusive. Based on the mathematical theory of RFT-based inference, we here develop power and positive predictive value (PPV) functions for voxel- and cluster-level inference in both uncorrected single test and corrected multiple testing scenarios. Moreover, we apply the theoretical results to evaluate the sample size necessary to achieve desired power and PPV levels based on an fMRI pilot study.},

	abstract = {Variational inference is a popular method for estimating model parameters and conditional distributions in hierarchical and mixed models, which arise frequently in many settings in the health, social, and biological sciences. Variational inference in a frequentist context works by approximating intractable conditional distributions with a tractable family and optimizing the resulting lower bound on the log-likelihood. The variational objective function is typically less computationally intensive to optimize than the true likelihood, enabling scientists to fit rich models even with extremely large datasets. Despite widespread use, little is known about the general theoretical properties of estimators arising from variational approximations to the log-likelihood, which hinders their use in inferential statistics. In this article, we connect such estimators to profile M-estimation, which enables us to provide regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of variational estimators. Our theory also motivates three methodological improvements to variational inference: estimation of the asymptotic model-robust covariance matrix, a one-step correction that improves estimator efficiency, and an empirical assessment of consistency. We evaluate the proposed results using simulation studies and data on marijuana use from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {A key challenge for modern Bayesian statistics is how to perform scalable inference of posterior distributions. To address this challenge, variational Bayes (VB) methods have emerged as a popular alternative to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. VB methods tend to be faster while achieving comparable predictive performance. However, there are few theoretical results around VB. In this article, we establish frequentist consistency and asymptotic normality of VB methods. Specifically, we connect VB methods to point estimates based on variational approximations, called frequentist variational approximations, and we use the connection to prove a variational Bernstein–von Mises theorem. The theorem leverages the theoretical characterizations of frequentist variational approximations to understand asymptotic properties of VB. In summary, we prove that (1) the VB posterior converges to the Kullback–Leibler (KL) minimizer of a normal distribution, centered at the truth and (2) the corresponding variational expectation of the parameter is consistent and asymptotically normal. As applications of the theorem, we derive asymptotic properties of VB posteriors in Bayesian mixture models, Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian stochastic block models. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate these theoretical results. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, psychology has seen a remarkable move to increasing research transparency, following several high-profile cases of scientific misconduct and the realization that reproducibility of psychological research findings may be disappointingly low. Taking from exact science disciplines such as experimental physics, there is increasing support for public sharing of empirical data, with some researchers even arguing that public data sharing should be a requirement for publication. Indeed, the principle of data transparency is a core value in science. However, in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, researchers work with human subject data. This makes that data sharing is subject to legal and ethical restrictions. Here we discuss the legal and ethical implications of public data sharing, as advocated by several authors. We conclude that large scale public sharing leads to inevitable legal and ethical problems with participant privacy, especially in the light of continuous technological developments. What might be ‘anonymity’ today could be become personal data tomorrow.},

We then articulate six possible alternative consent models: verbal consent, blanket consent, broad consent, meta consent, dynamic consent and waived consent. We argue that these models or conceptions of consent must be articulated in the context of the complexities of international legislation and non legislative national and international biobank governance frameworks and policies, those which govern research in the field of sports genetics. We discuss the tensions between individual rights and public benefits of genomic research as a critical ethical issue, particularly where benefits are less obvious, as in sports genomics. The inherent complexities of international regulation and biobanking governance are challenging in a relatively young field. We argue that there is much nuanced ethical work still to be done with regard to governance of sports genetic biobanking and the issues contained therein.},

In these methods, which include reconstruction from projections, Fourier imaging, spin-warp imaging, and echo-planar imaging, controllable gradient fields determine the points in the spatial-frequency domain which are sampled at any given time during the acquisition of data (the free induction decay, or FID). The detailed time dependence of the resulting trajectory of sample points (the k trajectory) determines the relative weight and accuracy with which image information at each spatial frequency is measured, establishing theoretical limitations on image quality achievable with a given imaging method. We demonstrate here that these considerations may be used to compare the theoretical capabilities of NMR imaging methods, and to derive new imaging methods with optimal theoretical imaging properties.},

	title = {An unbiased estimator for the roughness of a multivariate {Gaussian} random ﬁeld},
	abstract = {Images from positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are often modelled as stationary Gaussian random ﬁelds, and a general linear model is used to test for the eﬀect of explanatory varaibles on a set of such images (Friston et al., 1994; Worsley and Friston, 1995). Thompson et al. (1996) have modelled displacements of brain surfaces as a multivariate Gaussian random ﬁeld. In order to test for signiﬁcant local maxima in such ﬁelds using the theory of Adler (1981) and its recent reﬁnements (Worsley, 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Siegmund and Worsley, 1995), we need to estimate the roughness of such ﬁelds. This is deﬁned as the variance matrix of the derivative of the random ﬁeld in each dimension. Some methods have been given by Worlsey et al. (1992) for the special case of stationary variance of the random ﬁeld, and where the random ﬁeld is sampled on a uniform lattice. In this note we generalise to the case of multivariate Gaussian data with unknown non-stationary variance matrix, and non-lattice sampling. This latter is particularly important for studying the displacement of brain surfaces, which will be the subject of a future publication.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {To behave adaptively, we must learn from the consequences of our actions. Studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have been informative with respect to the question of how such learning occurs. These studies have revealed a frontocentral negativity termed the feedback-related negativity (FRN) that appears after negative feedback. According to one prominent theory, the FRN tracks the difference between the values of actual and expected outcomes, or reward prediction errors. As such, the FRN provides a tool for studying reward valuation and decision making. We begin this review by examining the neural signiﬁcance of the FRN. We then examine its functional signiﬁcance. To understand the cognitive processes that occur when the FRN is generated, we explore variables that inﬂuence its appearance and amplitude. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate four hypotheses: (1) the FRN encodes a quantitative reward prediction error; (2) the FRN is evoked by outcomes and by stimuli that predict outcomes; (3) the FRN and behavior change with experience; and (4) the system that produces the FRN is maximally engaged by volitional actions.},

	abstract = {Assessment of causal influences is a ubiquitous and important subject across diverse research fields. Drawn from consciousness studies, integrated information is a measure that defines integration as the degree of causal influences among elements. Whereas pairwise causal influences between elements can be quantified with existing methods, quantifying multiple influences among many elements poses two major mathematical difficulties. First, overestimation occurs due to interdependence among influences if each influence is separately quantified in a part-based manner and then simply summed over. Second, it is difficult to isolate causal influences while avoiding noncausal confounding influences. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a theoretical framework based on information geometry for the quantification of multiple causal influences with a holistic approach. We derive a measure of integrated information, which is geometrically interpreted as the divergence between the actual probability distribution of a system and an approximated probability distribution where causal influences among elements are statistically disconnected. This framework provides intuitive geometric interpretations harmonizing various information theoretic measures in a unified manner, including mutual information, transfer entropy, stochastic interaction, and integrated information, each of which is characterized by how causal influences are disconnected. In addition to the mathematical assessment of consciousness, our framework should help to analyze causal relationships in complex systems in a complete and hierarchical manner.},

	abstract = {When a hypothesis is tested by a significance test and is not rejected, it is generally agreed that all hypotheses implied by that hypothesis (its "components") must also be considered as non-rejected. However, when the hypothesis is rejected the question remains as to which components may also be rejected. Various writers have given attention to this question and have proposed a variety of multiple comparisons methods based either on tests of each one of the components or on simultaneous confidence bounds on parametric functions related to the various hypotheses. An approach to such methods, apparently originally due to Tukey [27], is to test each component hypothesis by comparing its statistic with the αα{\textbackslash}alpha level critical value of the statistic for the overall hypothesis. This is called a Simultaneous Test Procedure (STP for short) as all hypotheses may be tested simultaneously and without reference to one another. An STP involves no stepwise testing of the kind employed by some other methods of multiple comparisons for means, in which subsets are tested for equality only if they are contained in sets which have already been found significant. (See [3], [4], [10], [18]). A general formalization of STP's is attempted in this paper. Section 2 introduces the requisite concepts of families of hypotheses and the implication relations between them, as well as the monotonicity relations between the related statistics. Section 3 defines STP's and shows conditions for coherence and consonance of their decisions, these properties being that hypothesis implication relations are preserved in the decisions of the STP. Section 4 discusses comparison of various STP's for the same hypotheses and shows the advantages of the union-intersection type of statistics and of reducing the family of hypotheses tested as much as possible. Section 5 translates all these results to simultaneous confidence statements after introducing the definitions necessary to allow such translation. The analogy between simultaneous test and confidence methods is of special importance as it brings a wide spectrum of methods within this framework, most of which was originally formulated in confidence region terms. This covers the original work of Tukey [27] and Scheffe [25] and continues with that of Roy and his associates [21] and most recently Krishnaiah [12], [13]. A general discussion of this confidence approach has been given by Aitchison [1] since the first draft of the present paper. In view of the close analogies pointed out in Section 5, it is not surprising that Aitchison arrives at the requirement of a constant critical value for all his tests, exactly as in an STP. In fact his approach and the present one are complementary. The formal theory is illustrated with ANOVA examples to clarify the concepts. No essentially new techniques are presented in this paper though this approach has been used elsewhere by the author to derive a number of practically useful procedures [6], [7], [8].},

Here we present a simple analytic argument that NNs are in fact essentially polynomial regression models. This view will have various implications for NNs, e.g. providing an explanation for why convergence problems arise in NNs, and it gives rough guidance on avoiding overﬁtting. In addition, we use this phenomenon to predict and conﬁrm a multicollinearity property of NNs not previously reported in the literature. Most importantly, given this loose correspondence, one may choose to routinely use polynomial models instead of NNs, thus avoiding some major problems of the latter, such as having to set many tuning parameters and dealing with convergence issues. We present a number of empirical results; in each case, the accuracy of the polynomial approach matches or exceeds that of NN approaches.

	abstract = {Recently, Eklund et al. (1) analyzed clustering methods in standard fMRI packages: AFNI (which we maintain), FSL, and SPM. They claim that ( i ) false-positive rates (FPRs) in traditional approaches are greatly inflated, questioning the validity of “countless published fMRI studies”; ( ii ) nonparametric methods produce valid, but slightly conservative, FPRs; ( iii ) a common flawed assumption is that the spatial autocorrelation function (ACF) of fMRI noise is Gaussian-shaped; and ( iv ) a 15-y-old bug in AFNI’s 3dClustSim significantly contributed to producing “particularly high” FPRs compared with other software. We repeated simulations from ref. 1 [Beijing\_Zang data (2), cf. ref. 3) and comment on each point briefly.

Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent fMRI articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among fMRI studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

The goal of the paper was not to disparage any specific fMRI software, but to point out that parametric statistical methods are based on a number of assumptions that are not always valid for fMRI data, and that nonparametric statistical methods (5) are a good alternative. Through AFNI’s introduction of nonparametric statistics in the function 3dttest++ (3, 6), the three most common fMRI softwares now all support nonparametric group inference [SPM through the toolbox SnPM (www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/software/snpm), and FSL through the function randomise].

Cox et al. (3) correctly point out that the bug in the AFNI function 3dClustSim only had a minor impact on the false-positive rate (FPR). This was also covered in our original paper (1): “We note that FWE [familywise error] rates are lower with the bug-fixed 3dClustSim function. As an example, the updated function reduces the degree of false …

The optimal solution to this "explore-exploit" dilemma is often computationally challenging, but principled algorithmic approximations exist. These approximations utilize uncertainty about action values in different ways. Some random exploration algorithms scale the level of choice stochasticity with the level of uncertainty. Other directed exploration algorithms add a "bonus" to action values with high uncertainty. Random exploration algorithms are sensitive to total uncertainty across actions, whereas directed exploration algorithms are sensitive to relative uncertainty. This paper reports a multi-armed bandit experiment in which total and relative uncertainty were orthogonally manipulated. We found that humans employ both exploration strategies, and that these strategies are independently controlled by different uncertainty computations.},

When we only need a partial policy to get from a ﬁxed start state to a goal, restricting computation to states relevant to this task can make much larger problems tractable. We introduce a new algorithm, Bounded RTDP, which can produce partial policies with strong performance guarantees while only touching a fraction of the state space, even on problems where other algorithms would have to visit the full state space. To do so, Bounded RTDP maintains both upper and lower bounds on the optimal value function. The performance of Bounded RTDP is greatly aided by the introduction of a new technique to eﬃciently ﬁnd suitable upper bounds; this technique can also be used to provide informed initialization to a wide range of other planning algorithms.},

Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of ﬁring rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states. Finally, we show that there exist two types of retrieval states: one in which ﬁring rates are constant in time and another in which ﬁring rates ﬂuctuate chaotically.},

	abstract = {Unbalanced group-level models are common in neuroimaging. Typically, data for these models come from factorial experiments. As such, analyses typically take the form of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) within the framework of the general linear model (GLM). Although ANOVA theory is well established for the balanced case, in unbalanced designs there are multiple ways of decomposing the sums-of-squares of the data. This leads to several methods of forming test statistics when the model contains multiple factors and interactions. Although the Type I–III sums of squares have a long history of debate in the statistical literature, there has seemingly been no consideration of this aspect of the GLM in neuroimaging. In this paper we present an exposition of these different forms of hypotheses for the neuroimaging researcher, discussing their derivation as estimable functions of ANOVA models, and discussing the relative merits of each. Finally, we demonstrate how the different hypothesis tests can be implemented using contrasts in analysis software, presenting examples in SPM and FSL.},

	title = {Modelling group-level repeated measures of neuroimaging data using the univariate general linear model},
	abstract = {Group-level repeated measurements are common in neuroimaging, yet their analysis remains complex. Although a variety of specialised tools now exist, it is surprising that to-date there has been no clear discussion of how repeatedmeasurements can be appropriately modelled using the standard general linear model approach, implemented in software such as SPM and FSL. To understand how this can be achieved, two important concepts must be discussed. The ﬁrst is the use of expected mean squares in deﬁning suitable F-ratios for testing hypotheses. The second is the use of estimable functions in deﬁning suitable contrast weights in overparameterised designs. In this paper, both of these concepts will be discussed in detail, paying particular attention to how they apply in complex repeated-measurement analyses. A set of simple steps will then be given alongside an example of specifying a 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA in SPM. Equivalency of the results compared to other standard statistical software will also be demonstrated. The hope is that this paper will provide some clarity on this confusing topic, giving researchers the conﬁdence to correctly specify these forms of models in standard software packages.},

	abstract = {Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a methodological approach to study effective connectivity among brain regions. Based on a set of observations and a biophysical model of brain interactions, DCM uses a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the free parameters of the model (e.g. modulation of connectivity) and infer architectural properties of the most plausible model (i.e. model selection). When modeling electrophysiological event-related responses, the estimation of the model relies on the integration of the system of delay differential equations (DDEs) that describe the dynamics of the system. In this technical note, we compared two numerical schemes for the integration of DDEs. The ﬁrst, and standard, scheme approximates the DDEs (more precisely, the state of the system, with respect to conduction delays among brain regions) using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and solves it with a ﬁxed step size. The second scheme uses a dedicated DDEs solver with adaptive step sizes to control error, making it theoretically more accurate. To highlight the effects of the approximation used by the ﬁrst integration scheme in regard to parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection, we performed simulations of local ﬁeld potentials using ﬁrst, a simple model comprising 2 regions and second, a more complex model comprising 6 regions. In these simulations, the second integration scheme served as the standard to which the ﬁrst one was compared. Then, the performances of the two integration schemes were directly compared by ﬁtting a public mismatch negativity EEG dataset with different models. The simulations revealed that the use of the standard DCM integration scheme was acceptable for Bayesian model selection but underestimated the connectivity parameters and did not allow an accurate estimation of conduction delays. Fitting to empirical data showed that the models systematically obtained an increased accuracy when using the second integration scheme. We conclude that inference on connectivity strength and delay based on DCM for EEG/MEG requires an accurate integration scheme.},

	abstract = {There is significant evidence that in addition to reward-punishment based decision making, the Basal Ganglia (BG) contributes to risk-based decision making as well. Despite this evidence, little is known about the computational principles and neural correlates of risk computation in this subcortical system. We have previously proposed a reinforcement learning based model of the BG that simulates the interactions between dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in a diverse set of experimental effects including reward, punishment and risk based decision making. Starting with the idea that the activity of DA represents reward prediction error, the model posits that serotoninergic activity in the striatum controls risk-prediction error. Our prior model of the BG was an abstract model that did not incorporate anatomical and cellular-level data. In this work, we expand the earlier model into a detailed network model of the BG and demonstrate the joint contributions of DA-5HT in risk and reward-punishment sensitivity. At the core of the proposed network model is the following insight regarding cellular correlates of value and risk computation. Just as DA D1 receptor (D1R) expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum were thought to be neural substrates for value computation, we propose that DA D1R and D2R co-expressing MSNs, reported to occupy a significant proportion of the striatum and are implicated in disorders like schizophrenia and drug addiction, are capable of computing risk. Ours is the first-of-its-kind model that accounts for the significant computational possibilities of these co-expressing D1R-D2R MSNs, and describes how DA-5HT mediated activity in these classes of neurons (D1R-, D2R-, D1R-D2R- MSNs) contribute to the BG dynamics. We also apply the model to capture the behaviour of PD patients in a probabilistic learning paradigm. The study observes that optimizing 5HT levels along with DA medication could be essential to improving the patients' learning},

	abstract = {Most reinforcement learning algorithms optimize the expected return of a Markov Decision Problem. Practice has taught us the lesson that this criterion is not always the most suitable because many applications require robust control strategies which also take into account the variance of the return. Classical control literature provides several techniques to deal with risk-sensitive optimization goals like the so-called worst-case optimality criterion exclusively focusing on risk-avoiding policies or classical risk-sensitive control, which transforms the returns by exponential utility functions. While the first approach is typically too restrictive, the latter suffers from the absence of an obvious way to design a corresponding model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.Our risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm is based on a very different philosophy. Instead of transforming the return of the process, we transform the temporal differences during learning. While our approach reflects important properties of the classical exponential utility framework, we avoid its serious drawbacks for learning. Based on an extended set of optimality equations we are able to formulate risk-sensitive versions of various well-known reinforcement learning algorithms which converge with probability one under the usual conditions.},

	abstract = {Rewards are crucial objects that induce learning, approach behavior, choices, and emotions. Whereas emotions are difficult to investigate in animals, the learning function is mediated by neuronal reward prediction error signals which implement basic constructs of reinforcement learning theory. These signals are found in dopamine neurons, which emit a global reward signal to striatum and frontal cortex, and in specific neurons in striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex projecting to select neuronal populations. The approach and choice functions involve subjective value, which is objectively assessed by behavioral choices eliciting internal, subjective reward preferences. Utility is the formal mathematical characterization of subjective value and a prime decision variable in economic choice theory. It is coded as utility prediction error by phasic dopamine responses. Utility can incorporate various influences, including risk, delay, effort, and social interaction. Appropriate for formal decision mechanisms, rewards are coded as object value, action value, difference value, and chosen value by specific neurons. Although all reward, reinforcement, and decision variables are theoretical constructs, their neuronal signals constitute measurable physical implementations and as such confirm the validity of these concepts. The neuronal reward signals provide guidance for behavior while constraining the free will to act.},

	volume = {29},
	issn = {0003-4851},
	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2237272},
	abstract = {The mixed model in a 2-way analysis of variance is characterized by a fixed classification, e.g., treatments, and a random classification, e.g., plots or individuals. If we consider \$k\$ different treatments each applied to everyone of \$n\$ individuals, and assume the usual analysis of variance assumptions of uncorrelated errors, equal variances and normality, an appropriate analysis for the set of \$nk\$ observations \$x\_\{ij\}, i = 1, 2, {\textbackslash}cdots n, j = 1, 2, {\textbackslash}cdots k\$, is ???? where the \$F\$ ratio under the null hypothesis has the \$F\$ distribution with \$(k - 1)\$ and \$(k - 1)(n - 1)\$ degrees of freedom. As is well known, if we extend the situation so that the errors have equal correlations instead of being uncorrelated, the \$F\$ ratio has the same distribution. Under the null hypothesis, the numerator estimates the same quantity as the denominator, namely, \$(1 - {\textbackslash}rho){\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$, where \${\textbackslash}rho\$ is the constant correlation coefficient among the treatments. This case can also be considered as a sampling of \$n\$ vectors (individuals) from a \$k\$-variate normal population with variance-covariance matrix \$\$V = {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}begin\{pmatrix\} 1 \& {\textbackslash}rho \& {\textbackslash}cdots \& {\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rho \& \& \& {\textbackslash}vdots {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}vdots \& \& \& {\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rho \& {\textbackslash}cdots \& {\textbackslash}rho \& 1{\textbackslash}end\{pmatrix\}.\$\$ If we consider this type of formulation and suppose the \$k\$ treatment errors to have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix (the same for each individual), then the usual test described above is valid for \$k = 2\$. For \$k {\textgreater} 2\$, and \$n {\textbackslash}geqq k\$, Hotelling's \$T{\textasciicircum}2\$ is the appropriate test for the homogeneity of the treatment means. However, the working statistician is sometimes confronted with the case where \$k {\textgreater} n\$, or he does not have the adequate means for computing large order inverse matrices and would therefore like to use the original test ratio which in general does not have the requisite \$F\$ distribution. Box [1] and [2] has given an approximate distribution of the test ratio to be \$F{\textbackslash}lbrack(k - 1){\textbackslash}epsilon, (k - 1)(n - 1){\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}rbrack\$ where \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is a function of the population variances and covariances and may further be approximated by the sample variances and covariances. We show in Section 3 that \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}geqq (k - 1){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and therefore a conservative test would be \$F(1, n - 1)\$. Box referred only to one group of \$n\$ individuals. We shall extend his results to a frequently occurring case, namely, the analysis of \$g\$ groups where the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$th group has \$n\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ individuals, \${\textbackslash}alpha = 1, 2, {\textbackslash}cdots g\$, and \${\textbackslash}Sigma{\textasciicircum}g\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha = 1\} n\_{\textbackslash}alpha = N\$. We will show that the treatment mean square and the treatment \${\textbackslash}times\$ group interaction can be tested in the same approximate fashion by using the Box procedure.},

Just because algorithms are based on code doesn't mean experiments are easily replicated. Far from it. Unpublished codes and a sensitivity to training conditions have made it difficult for AI researchers to reproduce many key results. That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana, reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problem—and one laying out tools to mitigate it.
Unpublished code and sensitivity to training conditions make many claims hard to verify.

Es ist weiterhin auch DAS Nachschlagewerk im Masterstudium und in der Forschung: Beispiele aus dem psychologischen Forschungsalltag helfen beim Nachvollziehen von Berechnungen und ein Glossar liefert schnell die wichtigsten Begriffsdefinitionen. NEUES wurde sinnvoll ergänzt, die Didaktik optimiert: Die neue Auflage ist neu strukturiert, kürzere Kapitel sorgen für einen klareren Aufbau. Die Grundlagen werden für Einsteiger verständlicher und ausführlicher dargestellt. Markierungen kennzeichnen Vertiefungskapitel. Hinweise zu EDV-Anwendungen sind systematisch in Kästen hervorgehoben. Und besonders interessant für Anwender und die Prüfungsvorbereitung: Eine neue begleitende Website enthält Anleitungen für die Berechnung der im Buch enthaltenen Beispiele mit Statistikprogrammen (SPSS-Syntax) sowie Lerntools für Studierende und Materialien (Abbildungen und Folien) für Dozenten. Der BORTZ-SCHUSTER ist und bleibt ein unerlässliches Statistik-Lehrbuch für Studierende der Psychologie und Sozialwissenschaften, für Wissenschaftler und für Anwender},

It is an interdisciplinary field and crosses the borders of neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, radiology, mathematics, physics and engineering. Developments in techniques, procedures and our understanding of this field are expanding rapidly. In this second edition of this book provides an invaluable guide to how fMRI works, from introducing the basic ideas and principles to the underlying physics and physiology. He covers the relationship between fMRI and other imaging techniques and includes a guide to the statistical analysis of fMRI data.},

	abstract = {The brain’s decoding of fast sensory streams is currently impossible to emulate, even approximately, with artificial agents. For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of ‘stable heteroclinic channels’. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

A key feature of our model is that it achieves a separation between ambiguity, identiﬁed as a characteristic of the decision maker’s subjective beliefs, and ambiguity attitude, a characteristic of the decision maker’s tastes. We show that attitudes toward pure risk are characterized by the shape of u, as usual, while attitudes toward ambiguity are characterized by the shape of φ Ambiguity itself is deﬁned behaviorally and is shown to be characterized by properties of the subjective set of measures Π. One advantage of this model is that the well-developed machinery for dealing with risk attitudes can be applied as well to ambiguity attitudes. The model is also distinct from many in the literature on ambiguity in that it allows smooth, rather than kinked, indifference curves. This leads to different behavior and improved tractability, while still sharing the main features (e.g., Ellsberg’s paradox). The maxmin expected utility model (e.g., Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)) with a given set of measures may be seen as a limiting case of our model with inﬁnite ambiguity aversion. Two illustrative portfolio choice examples are offered.},

For this purpose, the ﬁrst contribution of this paper deals with a novel entropy approximation method for Gaussian mixture random vectors, which is based on a component-wise Taylor-series expansion of the logarithm of a Gaussian mixture and on a splitting method of Gaussian mixture components. The employed order of the Taylor-series expansion and the number of components used for splitting allows balancing between accuracy and computational demand. The second contribution is the determination of meaningful and efﬁciently to calculate lower and upper bounds of the entropy, which can be also used for approximation purposes. In addition, a reﬁnement method for the more important upper bound is proposed in order to approach the true entropy value.},

In addition to technical aspects, the two methods differ in their sensitivities to various cerebral sources. Moreover, it is more difficult to determine the lead fields of EEG than of MEG. If it can be assumed that only one localizedsource is active at a particular time, the source location, direction, and amplitude can be found with the dipole model. However, if the assumption of a single localizedsource is violated, erroneous results are obtained. If a few sources are responsible for the measured fields, multiple-dipole models can be used. In the general case one must start from the fundamentals of estimation theory. The use of a priori information, together with experimental data, will provide the best possible solution to the inverse problem. In the case of minimal prior information, the so-calledminimum-norm solution is obtained. With the help of supplementary information, the resolution can be further improved.},

In humans, however, the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis of acute MDMA effects remains unknown. The distribution of active neuronal populations after administration of a single dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo was studied in 16 healthy, MDMA-na¨ıve volunteers. Thirty-one-channel scalp EEGs during resting with open and closed eyes was analyzed in the different EEG frequency bands. Scalp maps of power showed signiﬁcant, global differences between MDMA and placebo in both eye conditions and all frequency bands. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute 3D, functional images of electric neuronal activity from the scalp EEG data. MDMA produced a widespread decrease of slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional processes. Comparison of the MDMAspeciﬁc EEG pattern with that of various 5-HT, DA, and NA agonists indicates that serotonin, noradrenaline, and, to a lesser degree, dopamine, contribute to the effects of MDMA on EEG, and possibly also on mood and behavior.

A latency window to analyze the P300 was determined using the global fieldpower statistic. The spatial topography of the P300 over this window was characterized by a midline positivity that decreased in amplitude with spatial distance from the peak. After sensory components were fit, the source of P300 could be accounted for by 1 or 2 EDs, which were usually located near medial temporal areas. This result is at odds with evidencefrom depth recordings during the oddball paradigm, showing that multiple regions of the brain are active during this interval.},

	abstract = {Neuronal activity causes local changes in cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and blood oxygenation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation were developed by high-speed echo planar imaging. These techniques were used to obtain completely noninvasive tomographic maps of human brain activity, by using visual and motor stimulus paradigms. Changes in blood oxygenation were detected by using a gradient echo (GE) imaging sequence sensitive to the paramagnetic state of deoxygenated hemoglobin. Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion recovery (IR), tissue relaxation parameter Tl-sensitive pulse sequence. A series of images were acquired continuously with the same imaging pulse sequence (either GE or IR) during task activation. Cine display of subtraction images (activated minus baseline) directly demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain MR signal observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During 8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase in signal intensity (paired t test; P {\textless} 0.001) of 1.8\% ± 0.8\% (GE) and 1.8\% ± 0.9\% (ID) was observed in the primary visual cortex (Vi) of seven normal volunteers. The mean rise-time constant of the signal change was 4.4 ± 2.2 s for the GE images and 8.9 ± 2.8 s for the IR images. The stimulation frequency dependence of visual activation agrees with previous positron emission tomography observations, with the largest MR signal response occurring at 8 Hz. Similar signal changes were observed within the human primary motor cortex (Ml) during a hand squeezing task and in animal models of increased blood flow by hypercapnia. By using intrinsic blood-tissue contrast, functional MRI opens a spatialtemporal window onto individual brain physiology.},

Actually ME can be used to assign a probability law to an unknown quantity when we have macroscopic data (expectations) on it. ML can be used to estimate the parameters of a probability law when we have microscopic data (direct observation). BAYES can be used to update a prior probability law when we have microscopic data through the likelihood. When we have both microscopic and macroscopic data we can use ﬁrst ME to assign a prior and then use BAYES to update it to the posterior law thus doing the desired data fusion. However, in practical data fusion applications, we may still need some engineering feeling to propose realistic data fusion solutions. Some simple examples in sensor data fusion and image reconstruction using diﬀerent kind of data are presented to illustrate these ideas.},

	abstract = {A solution of the forward problem is an important component of any method for computing the spatio-temporal activity of the neural sources of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. The forward problem involves computing the scalp potentials or external magnetic ﬁeld at a ﬁnite set of sensor locations for a putative source conﬁguration. We present a uniﬁed treatment of analytical and numerical solutions of the forward problem in a form suitable for use in inverse methods. This formulation is achieved through factorization of the lead ﬁeld into the product of the moment of the elemental current dipole source with a “kernel matrix” that depends on the head geometry and source and sensor locations, and a “sensor matrix” that models sensor orientation and gradiometer effects in MEG and differential measurements in EEG. Using this formulation and a recently developed approximation formula for EEG, based on the “Berg parameters,” we present novel reformulations of the basic EEG and MEG kernels that dispel the myth that EEG is inherently more complicated to calculate than MEG. We also present novel investigations of different boundary element methods (BEM’s) and present evidence that improvements over currently published BEM methods can be realized using alternative error-weighting methods. Explicit expressions for the matrix kernels for MEG and EEG for spherical and realistic head geometries are included.},

	abstract = {A general class of linear time invariant systems with time delay is studied. Recently, they attracted considerable interest in the systems and control community. The complexity arises due to the exponential type transcendental terms in their characteristic equation. The transcendentality brings infinitely many characteristic roots, which are cumbersome to elaborate as evident from the literature. A number of methodologies have been suggested with limited ability to assess the stability in the parametric domain of time delay. This study offers an exact, structured and robust methodology to bring a closure to the question at hand. Ultimately we present a unique explicit analytical expression in terms of the system parameters which not only reveals the stability regions (pockets) in the domain of time delay, but it also declares the number of unstable characteristic roots at any given pocket. The method starts with the determination of all possible purely imaginary (resonant) characteristic roots for any positive time delay. To achieve this a simplifying substitution is used for the transcendental terms in the characteristic equation. It is proven that the number of such resonant roots for a given dynamics is finite. Each one of these roots is created by infinitely many time delays, which are periodically distributed. An interesting property is also claimed next, that the root crossing directions at these locations are invariant with respect to the delay and dependent only on the crossing frequency. These two unique findings facilitate a simple and practical stability method, which is the highlight of the work.},

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-conﬁdent inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-ofsample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but di ers considerably in the details and in the use of the word reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading o exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the eld via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {Estimation of statistical power in functional MRI (fMRI) requires knowledge of the expected percent signal change between two conditions as well as estimates of the variability in percent signal change. Variability can be divided into intra-subject variability, reflecting noise within the time series, and inter-subject variability, reflecting subject-to-subject differences in activation. The purpose of this study was to obtain estimates of percent signal change and the two sources of variability from fMRI data, and then use these parameter estimates in simulation experiments in order to generate power curves. Of interest from these simulations were conclusions concerning how many subjects are needed and how many time points within a scan are optimal in an fMRI study of cognitive function. Intra-subject variability was estimated from resting conditions, and inter-subject variability and percent signal change were estimated from verbal working memory data. Simulations derived from these parameters illustrate how percent signal change, intra- and inter-subject variability, and number of time points affect power. An empirical test experiment, using fMRI data acquired during somatosensory stimulation, showed good correspondence between the simulation-based power predictions and the power observed within somatosensory regions of interest. Our analyses suggested that for a liberal threshold of 0.05, about 12 subjects were required to achieve 80\% power at the single voxel level for typical activations. At more realistic thresholds, that approach those used after correcting for multiple comparisons, the number of subjects doubled to maintain this level of power. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We addressed attentional modulation of effective connectivity using variable parameter regression and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We present data from a single subject scanned under identical stimulus conditions (visual motion) while varying only the attentional component of the task. Variable parameter regression of the inﬂuence of V5 on PP revealed increased effective connectivity during attention to visual motion. With this dynamic measure of effective connectivity we were able to make inferences about the source of modulation by looking for regions that predicted the observed changes in connectivity. Using an ordinary regression analysis, we showed that activity in the prefrontal cortex could explain these changes and was sufficient to account for these modulatory inﬂuences on connections in the dorsal visual pathway.

The approximate Variational Bayesian method applied to these models is an attractive approach, used successfully in applications ranging from acoustics to bioinformatics. The most challenging aspect of implementing the method is in performing inference on the hidden state sequence of the model. We show how to convert the inference problem so that standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions from the literature may be applied. This is in contrast to previously published approaches based on Belief Propagation. Our framework both simpliﬁes and uniﬁes the inference problem, so that future applications may be more easily developed. We demonstrate the elegance of the approach on Bayesian temporal ICA, with an application to ﬁnding independent dynamical processes underlying noisy EEG signals.},

Here we explored whether selective averaging techniques similar to those applied in event-related potential (ERP) experiments could be used to demonstrate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to rapidly intermixed trials. In the ﬁrst two experiments, we observed that for 1-sec trials of full-ﬁeld visual checkerboard stimulation, the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal summated in a roughly linear fashion across successive trials even at very short (2 sec and 5 sec) intertrial intervals, although subtle departures from linearity were observed. In experiments 3 and 4, we observed that it is possible to obtain robust activation maps for rapidly presented randomly mixed trial types (left- and right-hemiﬁeld visual checkerboard stimulation) spaced as little as 2 sec apart. Taken collectively, these results suggest that selective averaging may enable fMRI experimental designs identical to those used in typical behavioral and ERP studies. The ability to analyze closely spaced single-trial, or event-related, signals provides for a class of experiments which cannot be conducted using blocked designs. Trial types can be randomly intermixed, and selective averaging based upon trial type and/or subject performance is possible. Hum. Brain Mapping 5:329–340, 1997.},

A previously developed lumped-parameter model of a single cortical column was implemented using a more accurate computational procedure. Anatomically acceptable values for the various model parameters were determined, and a multi-dimensional exploration of the model parameter-space was conducted. It was found that the model could produce a large variety of EEG-like waveforms and rhythms. Coupling two models, with delays in the interconnections to simulate the synaptic connections within and between cortical areas, made it possible to replicate the spatial distribution of alpha and beta activity. EPs were simulated by presenting pulses to the input of the coupled models. In general, the responses were more realistic than those produced using a single model. Our simulations also suggest that the scalp-recorded EP is at least partially due to a phase reordering of the ongoing activity.},

However, the book reflects the characteristics of the time, especially in terms of mathematical rigor. In this paper we point out the fundamental aspects of this reference work, especially the thorough coverage of testing problems and the construction of both estimation and testing noninformative priors based on functional divergences.

VEPs were recorded in response to a small circular checkerboard stimulus that was flashed over a range of visual field positions. Temporally and spatially overlapping VEP components were distinguished by differences in retinotopic sensitivity and scalp topography, and by inverse dipole modeling. The C1 component (5Cr80 ms) was found to change its polarity and topography systematically as a function of stimulus position in a manner consistent with the retinotopic organization of the striate cortex. The P1 component (comprised of the P75 and PlO0 subcomponents) had a time course that overlapped the C1 but could be distinguished from the C1 by its differingtopography and reduced sensitivityto stimulus position. The P1 generators were localized to the lateral extrastriate cortex. Inverse dipole models were consistent with these striate and extrastriate source locations for the C1 and P1, respectively. The N1 component (120-180 ms) was found to originate from several spatially distinct generators that differed in their retinotopic organization. B 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: QRS and ventricular beat detection is a basic procedure for electrocardiogram (ECG) processing and analysis. Large variety of methods have been proposed and used, featuring high percentages of correct detection. Nevertheless, the problem remains open especially with respect to higher detection accuracy in noisy ECGs
Methods: A real-time detection method is proposed, based on comparison between absolute values of summed differentiated electrocardiograms of one of more ECG leads and adaptive threshold. The threshold combines three parameters: an adaptive slew-rate value, a second value which rises when high-frequency noise occurs, and a third one intended to avoid missing of low amplitude beats. Two algorithms were developed: Algorithm 1 detects at the current beat and Algorithm 2 has an RR interval analysis component in addition. The algorithms are self-adjusting to the thresholds and weighting constants, regardless of resolution and sampling frequency used. They operate with any number L of ECG leads, selfsynchronize to QRS or beat slopes and adapt to beat-to-beat intervals.
Results: The algorithms were tested by an independent expert, thus excluding possible author's influence, using all 48 full-length ECG records of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The results were: sensitivity Se = 99.69 \% and specificity Sp = 99.65 \% for Algorithm 1 and Se = 99.74 \% and Sp = 99.65 \% for Algorithm 2.
Conclusion: The statistical indices are higher than, or comparable to those, cited in the scientific literature.},

	doi = {10.1186/1753-4631-4-S1-S8},
	abstract = {Background: Recently, it was realized that the functional connectivity networks estimated from actual brainimaging technologies (MEG, fMRI and EEG) can be analyzed by means of the graph theory, that is a mathematical representation of a network, which is essentially reduced to nodes and connections between them.
Methods: We used high-resolution EEG technology to enhance the poor spatial information of the EEG activity on the scalp and it gives a measure of the electrical activity on the cortical surface. Afterwards, we used the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) that is a multivariate spectral measure for the estimation of the directional influences between any given pair of channels in a multivariate dataset. Finally, a graph theoretical approach was used to model the brain networks as graphs. These methods were used to analyze the structure of cortical connectivity during the attempt to move a paralyzed limb in a group (N=5) of spinal cord injured patients and during the movement execution in a group (N=5) of healthy subjects.
Results: Analysis performed on the cortical networks estimated from the group of normal and SCI patients revealed that both groups present few nodes with a high out-degree value (i.e. outgoing links). This property is valid in the networks estimated for all the frequency bands investigated. In particular, cingulate motor areas (CMAs) ROIs act as ‘‘hubs’’ for the outﬂow of information in both groups, SCI and healthy. Results also suggest that spinal cord injuries affect the functional architecture of the cortical network sub-serving the volition of motor acts mainly in its local feature property. In particular, a higher local efficiency El can be observed in the SCI patients for three frequency bands, theta (3-6 Hz), alpha (7-12 Hz) and beta (13-29 Hz). By taking into account all the possible pathways between different ROI couples, we were able to separate clearly the network properties of the SCI group from the CTRL group. In particular, we report a sort of compensatory mechanism in the SCI patients for the Theta (3-6 Hz) frequency band, indicating a higher level of “activation” Ω within the cortical network during the motor task. The activation index is directly related to diffusion, a type of dynamics that underlies several biological systems including possible spreading of neuronal activation across several cortical regions.
Conclusions: The present study aims at demonstrating the possible applications of graph theoretical approaches in the analyses of brain functional connectivity from EEG signals. In particular, the methodological aspects of the i) cortical activity from scalp EEG signals, ii) functional connectivity estimations iii) graph theoretical indexes are emphasized in the present paper to show their impact in a real application.},

However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by ‘training them discriminatively’, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the beneﬁt of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions.},

	abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event-related or single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event-related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a ﬁxed inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event-related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept ﬁxed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by ﬁxed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacriﬁcing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide maps of brain activation with millimeter spatial resolution but is limited in its temporal resolution to the order of seconds. Here, we describe a technique that combines structural and functional MRI with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to obtain spatiotemporal maps of human brain activity with millisecond temporal resolution. This new technique was used to obtain dynamic statistical parametric maps of cortical activity during semantic processing of visually presented words. An initial wave of activity was found to spread rapidly from occipital visual cortex to temporal, parietal, and frontal areas within 185 ms, with a high degree of temporal overlap between different areas. Repetition effects were observed in many of the same areas following this initial wave of activation, providing evidence for the involvement of feedback mechanisms in repetition priming.},

We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving POMDPs off line and show how, in some cases, a ﬁnite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of ﬁnding exact solutions to POMDPs, and of some possibilities for ﬁnding approximate solutions. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Accordingly, it is argued that, by only reporting probability values and referring to statistical analyses as repeated measures ANOVA, authors convey neither the type of analysis that was used nor the validity of the reported probability value, since each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. The various approaches are presented with a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations are made regarding the ‘best’ choice of analysis.

	abstract = {Objectives and methods: Visually evoked potentials (VEPs) are known to be sensitive to spatial frequency, especially in the time range between 50 and 100 ms post-stimulus. In two experiments we localized the cortical activity elicited by stimuli of varying spatial frequency in scalp-recorded brain potentials, using multi-electrode recordings and dipole-source analysis.
Results: Low spatial frequencies (,1 c/d) activated relatively lateral occipital areas, the orientation of the neural ensembles involved being predominantly perpendicular to the scalp surface. In contrast, high spatial frequencies (.4 c/d) induced activation of more medial occipital areas with the predominant orientation of the sources being much more parallel to the scalp surface. Furthermore, at about 100 ms latency the lateral-occipital response to low spatial frequencies was stronger in the right hemisphere; no such asymmetry was found for the responses to the high spatial frequencies. These ®ndings were consistent across varying recording conditions, individual subjects, subject populations, stimulus characteristics (grating orientation, grating vs. checkerboard), and task conditions (active vs. passive).
Conclusion: The results indicate that there are differences in sensitivity to speci®c spatial frequencies between primary and secondary visual areas, as well as between the right and the left hemispheres. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Multi-armed bandits may be viewed as decompositionally-structured Markov decision processes (MDP's) with potentially very large state sets. A particularly elegant methodology for computing optimal policies was developed over twenty ago by Gittins Gittins \& Jones, 1974]. Gittins' approach reduces the problem of nding optimal policies for the original MDP to a sequence of low-dimensional stopping problems whose solutions determine the optimal policy through the so-called {\textbackslash}Gittins indices." Katehakis and Veinott Katehakis \& Veinott, 1987] have shown that the Gittins index for a task in state i may be interpreted as a particular component of the maximum-value function associated with the {\textbackslash}restart-in-i" process, a simple MDP to which standard solution methods for computing optimal policies, such as successive approximation, apply. This paper explores the problem of learning the Gittins indices on-line without the aid of a process model; it suggests utilizing task-state-speci c Q-learning agents to solve their respective restart-in-state-i subproblems, and includes an example in which the online reinforcement learning approach is applied to a simple problem of stochastic scheduling{\textbar}one instance drawn from a wide class of problems that may be formulated as bandit problems.},

Their technique is based on a real block – Schur decomposition of the Jacobian of the right hand side of the ODE. As a result of the analysis, a computationally cheap monitor for the possible necessary recovering of the splitting is derived by singular perturbation theory. Numerical experiments on moderate size, but challenging reaction kinetics problems document the eﬃciency of the new device within a linearly-implicit stiﬀ integrator.},

	abstract = {Manual debugging is expensive. And the high cost has motivated extensive research on automated fault localization in both software engineering and data mining communities. Fault localization aims at automatically locating likely fault locations, and hence assists manual debugging. A number of fault localization algorithms have been developed in recent years, which prove eﬀective when multiple failing and passing cases are available. However, we notice what is more commonly encountered in practice is the two-sample debugging problem, where only one failing and one passing cases are available. This problem has been either overlooked or insuﬃciently tackled in previous studies.},

The first responses, peaking around 20 and 35 ms, were explained by activation of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) hand area. All subjects showed additional deflections which peaked after 85 ms; the source locations agreed with the sites of the secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) in both hemispheres. The SII responses were typically stronger in the left than the right hemisphere. All subjects had an additional source, not previously reported in human evoked response data, in the contralateral parietal cortex. This source was posterior and medial to the SI hand area, and evidently in the wall of the postcentral sulcus. It was most active at 70-110 ms.},

With a proper design of the channels, this translates into a sequential rate-distortion problem, where we minimize the rate of information required for the controller’s operation under a constraint on its external cost. Memoryless controllers are of particular interest both for the simplicity and frugality of their implementation and as a basis for studying more complex controllers. In this paper we present the optimality principle for memoryless linear controllers that utilize minimal information rates to achieve a guaranteed external-cost level. We also study the interesting and useful phenomenology of the optimal controller, such as the principled reduction of its order.},

	title = {Imaging the {Electrical} {Activity} of the {Brain}: {ELECTRA}},
	abstract = {The construction of a tomography of neuronal sources is limited by a lack of information. A possible way around this problem is to change the biophysical model that underlies the statement of the inverse problem, i.e., searching for magnitudes that can be better determined from the available data. In this report, we describe a mathematical characterization of the type of currents that are actually able to produce the scalp-recorded EEG. Considering this characterization, we reformulate the bioelectric inverse problem. This approach, called ELECTRA, yields some advantages over the classical formulation in terms of the current density vector: (1) the number of unknowns can be reduced, which is equivalent to increasing the number of independent measurements, (2) the constraints used to reformulate the problem are undeniable since they do not imply any hypothesis about brain function but are instead based on the character of the measurements, and (3) existing experimental evidence suggests that the proposed source model characterizes the type of currents that arise in excitable tissues. We conclude that if the latter fact proves to be true for brain tissues, then no additional information is added to the inverse problem by using a more general source model than the one proposed here. Images obtained using this method for synthetic data, as well as early and middle components of human visual evoked responses to checkerboard stimuli, are presented to illustrate the characteristics of the reconstructed maps and their interpretation.

In BOLD fMRI, what is actually measured is only indirectly related to neuronal activity through a process that is still under investigation. A convenient way to analyze BOLD fMRI data consists of considering the whole brain as a system characterized by a transfer response function, called the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF).

	abstract = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide an elegant mathematical framework for modeling complex decision and planning problems in stochastic domains in which states of the system are observable only indirectly, via a set of imperfect or noisy observations. The modeling advantage of POMDPs, however, comes at a price —exact methods for solving them are computationally very expensive and thus applicable in practice only to very simple problems. We focus on eﬃcient approximation (heuristic) methods that attempt to alleviate the computational problem and trade oﬀ accuracy for speed. We have two objectives here. First, we survey various approximation methods, analyze their properties and relations and provide some new insights into their diﬀerences. Second, we present a number of new approximation methods and novel reﬁnements of existing techniques. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on a problem from the agent navigation domain.},

	abstract = {Multivariate restricted maximum likelihood (REML) (co)variance component estimation using numerical optimization on the basis of Downhill-Simplex (DS) or quasiNewton (QN) procedures suffers from the problem of undefined ’covariance matrices’ as are produced by the optimizers. So far, this problem has been dealt with by assigning ’bad’ function values. For this procedure to work, it is implied that the information this ’bad’ function value conveys is sufficient to avoid going in the same direction in the following optimization step. To a limited degree DS can cope with this situation. On the other hand QN usually breaks down if this situation occurs too frequently. This contribution analyzes the problem and proposes a reparameterization of the covariance matrices to solve it. As a result, faster converging QN optimizers can be used, as they no longer suffer from lack of robustness. Four real data sets were analyzed using a multivariate model estimating between 17 and 30 (co)variance components simultaneously. Optimizing on the Cholesky factor instead of on the (co)variance components themselves reduced the computing time by a factor of 2.5 to more than 250, when comparing the robust modified DS optimizer operating on the original covariance matrices to a QN optimizer using reparameterized covariance matrices.},

	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood has gained wide acceptance for estimating variance components by animal breeders. Converged solutions from maximization algorithms are usually considered REML solutions. However, neither the expectation maximization nor the derivative-free downhill simplex algorithm guarantees convergence to the global maximum. To investigate the occurrence of multiple solutions, residual and additive genetic covariance matrice·s for two traits were estimated by the derivative-free approach using the downhill simplex method and an EM algorithm for a multivariate animal model. Expectation maximization yielded three different converged solutions for the data set used, while downhill simplex identified two of the three expectation maximization solutions. Multiple solutions from both expectation maximization and downhill simplex suggest the existence of local maxima. Visualization of the log-likelihood surface however, did not support this view. Instead, points of inflection in some of the dimensions could be the cause for multiple solutions. The results prove that multiple solutions can exist, casting doubt on the merit of algorithms-like expectation maximization and downhill simplex{\textasciitilde}at do not guarantee global maximization. Downhill simplex was superior to expectation maximization. In terms of central processing unit time it was faster by a factor of 22 misidentifying only one solution instead of 2 as expectation maximization did.},

	abstract = {Recordings directly within the brain can establish local evoked potential generation without the ambiguities always associated with extracranial electromagnetic measures. Depth recordings have found that sensory stimuli activate primary cortex and then material-speciﬁc encoders. Sensory-speciﬁc areas remain active for long periods, but by about 200 ms are joined by activation in widespread brain systems. One system is related to the orientation of attention. It is centered in paralimbic and attentional frontoparietocingular cortex, and associated with the P3a. A second system associated with P3b envelopes cognitive contextual integration. It engages the ventral temporofrontal eventencoding cortices (inferotemporal, perirhinal, and ventrolateral prefrontal), association cortices (superior temporal sulcal and posterior parietal), and the hippocampus. Thus, even in simple tasks, activation is widespread but concentrated in particular multilobar systems. With this information, the late cognitive potentials can be used to monitor the probable location, timing and intensity of brain activation during cognitive tasks. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

An important and common question in DNA microarray experiments is the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes, that is, genes whose expression levels are associated with a response or covariate of interest. The biological question of differential expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates. As a typical microarray experiment measures expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are generated. This article discusses different approaches to multiple hypothesis testing in the context of DNA microarray experiments and compares the procedures on microarray and simulated data sets.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging produces data that are continuous in one or more dimensions. This calls for an inference framework that can handle data that approximate functions of space, for example, anatomical images, time–frequency maps and distributed source reconstructions of electromagnetic recordings over time. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is the standard framework for whole-brain inference in neuroimaging: SPM uses random field theory to furnish p-values that are adjusted to control family-wise error or false discovery rates, when making topological inferences over large volumes of space. Random field theory regards data as realizations of a continuous process in one or more dimensions. This contrasts with classical approaches like the Bonferroni correction, which consider images as collections of discrete samples with no continuity properties (i.e., the probabilistic behavior at one point in the image does not depend on other points). Here, we illustrate how random field theory can be applied to data that vary as a function of time, space or frequency. We emphasize how topological inference of this sort is invariant to the geometry of the manifolds on which data are sampled. This is particularly useful in electromagnetic studies that often deal with very smooth data on scalp or cortical meshes. This application illustrates the versatility and simplicity of random field theory and the seminal contributions of Keith Worsley (1951–2009), a key architect of topological inference.},

	abstract = {Conventionally, set-level inference on statistical parametric maps (SPMs) is based on the topological features of an excursion set above some threshold—for example, the number of clusters or Euler characteristic. The expected Euler characteristic—under the null hypothesis—can be predicted from an intrinsic measure or volume of the SPM, such as the resel counts or the Lipschitz–Killing curvatures (LKC). We propose a new approach that performs a null hypothesis omnibus test on an SPM, by testing whether its intrinsic volume (described by LKC coefﬁcients) is different from the volume of the underlying residual ﬁelds: intuitively, whether the number of peaks in the statistical ﬁeld (testing for signal) and the residual ﬁelds (noise) are consistent or not. Crucially, this new test requires no arbitrary feature-deﬁning threshold but is nevertheless sensitive to distributed or spatially extended patterns. We show the similarities between our approach and conventional topological inference—in terms of false positive rate control and sensitivity to treatment effects—in two and three dimensional simulations. The test consistently improves on classical approaches for moderate ({\textgreater} 20) degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate the application to real data and illustrate the comparison of the expected and observed Euler characteristics over the complete threshold range.},

This paper studies the Euler characteristic of the excursion set of a random field; the excursion set is the set of points where the image exceeds a fixed threshold, and the Euler characteristic counts the number of connected components in the excursion set minus the number of ‘holes'. For high thresholds the Euler characteristic is a measure of the number of peaks. The geometry of excursion sets has been studied by Adler (1981) who gives the expectation of two excursion set characteristics, called the DT (differential topology) and IG (integral geometry) characteristics, which equal the Euler characteristic provided the excursion set does not touch the boundary of the region. Worsley (1995) finds a boundary correction which gives the expectation of the Euler characteristic itself in two and three dimensions. The proof uses a representation of the Euler characteristic given by Hadwiger (1959). The purpose of this paper is to give a general result for any number of dimensions. The proof takes a different approach and uses a representation from Morse theory. Results are applied to the recently discovered anomalies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, thought to be the remnants of the creation of the universe.},

	abstract = {Certain three-dimensional images arising in medicine and astrophysics are modelled as a smooth random field, and experimenters are interested in the number of peaks or "hot-spots" present in such an image. This paper studies the Hadwiger characteristic of the excursion set of a random field. The excursion set is the set of points where the image exceeds a fixed threshold, and the Hadwiger characteristic, like the Euler characteristic, counts the number of connected components in the excursion set minus the number of "holes." For high thresholds the Hadwiger characteristic is a measure of the number of peaks. The geometry of excursion sets has been studied by Adler, who defined the IG (integral geometry) characteristic of excursion sets as a multidimensional analogue of the number of "upcrossings" of the threshold by a unidimensional process. The IG characteristic equals the Euler characteristic of an excursion set provided that the set does not touch the boundary of the volume, and Adler found the expected IG characteristic for a stationary random field inside a fixed volume. Worsley, Evans, Marrett and Neelin used the IG characteristic as an estimator of the number of regions of activation of positron emission tomography (PET) images of blood flow in the brain. Unfortunately the IG characteristic is only defined on intervals: it is not invariant under rotations and it can fail to count connected regions that touch the boundary. This is important since activation often occurs in the cortical regions near the boundary of the brain. In this paper we study the Hadwiger characteristic, which is defined on arbitrary sets, is invariant under rotations and does count connected regions whether they touch the boundary or not. Our main result is a simple expression for the expected Hadwiger characteristic for an isotropic stationary random field in two and three dimensions and on a smooth surface embedded in three dimensions. Results are applied to PET studies of pain perception and word recognition.},

	abstract = {In an editorial (this issue), I argued that Eklund, Nichols, and Knutsson’s ‘null data’ reflected resting-state/default network activity that inflated their false-positive rates. Commentaries on that paper were received by Nichols, Eklund, and Knutsson (this issue), Hopfinger (this issue), and Cunningham and Koscik (this issue). In this author response, I consider these commentaries. Many issues stemming from Nichols et al. are identified including: (1) Nichols et al. did not provide convincing arguments that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data. (2) Eklund et al. presented one-sample t-test results in the main body of their paper showing that their permutation method was acceptable, while their supplementary results showed that this method produced false-positive rates that were similar to other methods. (3) Eklund et al. used the same event protocol for all the participants, which artifactually inflated the one-sample t-test false-positive rates. (4) At p {\textless} .001, using two-sample t-tests (which corrected for the flawed analysis), all the methods employed to correct for multiple comparisons had acceptable false-positive rates. (5) Eklund et al. contrasted resting-state periods, which produced many significant clusters of activity, while null data should arguably be associated with few, if any, significant activations. Eklund et al.’s entire set of results show that commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons have acceptable false-positive rates. Following Hopfinger along with Cunningham and Koscik, it is also highlighted that rather than focusing on only type I error, type I error and type II error should be balanced in fMRI analysis.},

	abstract = {Imaging human brain function with techniques such as magnetoencephalography1 typically requires a subject to perform tasks while their head remains still within a restrictive scanner. This artificial environment makes the technique inaccessible to many people, and limits the experimental questions that can be addressed. For example, it has been difficult to apply neuroimaging to investigation of the neural substrates of cognitive development in babies and children, or to study processes in adults that require unconstrained head movement (such as spatial navigation). Here we describe a magnetoencephalography system that can be worn like a helmet, allowing free and natural movement during scanning. This is possible owing to the integration of quantum sensors2,3, which do not rely on superconducting technology, with a system for nulling background magnetic fields. We demonstrate human electrophysiological measurement at millisecond resolution while subjects make natural movements, including head nodding, stretching, drinking and playing a ball game. Our results compare well to those of the current state-of-the-art, even when subjects make large head movements. The system opens up new possibilities for scanning any subject or patient group, with myriad applications such as characterization of the neurodevelopmental connectome, imaging subjects moving naturally in a virtual environment and investigating the pathophysiology of movement disorders.},

These results mean that detecting significant activations no longer depends on a fixed (and high) threshold, but can be effected at any (lower) threshold, in terms of the spatial extent of the activated region. The substantial improvement in sensitivity that ensues is illustrated using a power analysis and a simulated phantom activation study. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The problems that arise in describing this behaviour in the multiparameter setting are qualitatively different to those covered by the one-dimensional theory. Indeed, most of the really interesting problems are of a geometrical nature, and actually disappear in the simple case. The purpose of this book is to collect within one cover most of the contents of the substantial literature devoted to the sample function analysis of random fields, including a reasonably full and self-contained account of the geometry needed for its understanding. While working on this book I tried to write with two readers in mind. One was a mathematician, for whom it was necessary to present what I feel is a rather beautiful theory, incorporating the standards of rigour and exactness that mathematicians are accustomed to. The other reader was an applied scientist, working in one of the many subjects that employs random fields as an element of mathematical modelling. His needs are quite different, for he requires a full statement of useful results, presented in such a way that he is not required to follow long mathematical proofs in order to understand and use them. It is possible that by attempting to please both readers I will have satisfied neither. Nevertheless, I beg the patience of both readers when they come upon parts of the text obviously written for the other. To be able to read the book from cover to cover a reader will need a good working knowledge (at graduate student level) of the basic features of modern probability theory and, for Chapter 8, measure theory. Although a brief review of those aspects of probability theory required is given in Chapter 1, it is unreasonable to assume that this can serve as anything other than a convenient reference for a reader already familiar with this material. However, with the applied scientist in mind, I have attempted to present the main results of the book in such a fashion that they can be understood and used by a reader whose knowledge of probability incorporates little more than the notions of expectation and stochastic convergence.},

	abstract = {Establishing reliable, robust, and unique brain signatures from neuroimaging data is a prerequisite for precision psychiatry, and therefore a highly sought-after goal in contemporary neuroscience. Recently, the procedure of connectome ﬁngerprinting, using brain functional connectivity proﬁles as such signatures, was shown to be able to accurately identify individuals from a group of 126 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, the speciﬁcity and generalizability of this procedure were not tested. In this replication study, we show both for the original and an extended HCP data set (n ¼ 900 subjects), as well as for an additional data set of more commonly acquired imaging quality (n ¼ 84) that (i) although the high accuracy can be replicated for the larger HCP 900 data set, accuracy is (ii) lower for standard neuroimaging data, and, that (iii) connectome ﬁngerprinting may not be speciﬁc enough to distinguish between individuals. In addition, both accuracy and speciﬁcity are projected to drop considerably as the size of a data set increases. Although the moderate-to-high accuracies do suggest there is a portion of unique variance, our results suggest that connectomes may actually be quite similar across individuals. This outcome may be relevant to how precision psychiatry could beneﬁt from inferences based on functional connectomes.},

The tumors occur with 100\% penetrance in both POMC heterozygous and homozygous genotypes. Histological examinations reveal that tumors start from hyperplastic focal points of melanotrophic cells within the intermediate lobe.

	abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB), variational maximum likelihood (VML), restricted maximum likelihood (ReML), and maximum likelihood (ML) are cornerstone parametric statistical estimation techniques in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these model parameter estimation techniques are rarely covered in introductory statistical texts. Because of the widespread practical use of VB, VML, ReML, and ML in the neuroimaging community, we reasoned that a theoretical treatment of their relationships and their application in a basic modeling scenario may be helpful for both neuroimaging novices and practitioners alike. In this technical study, we thus revisit the conceptual and formal underpinnings of VB, VML, ReML, and ML and provide a detailed account of their mathematical relationships and implementational details. We further apply VB, VML, ReML, and ML to the general linear model (GLM) with non-spherical error covariance as commonly encountered in the ﬁrst-level analysis of fMRI data. To this end, we explicitly derive the corresponding free energy objective functions and ensuing iterative algorithms. Finally, in the applied part of our study, we evaluate the parameter and model recovery properties of VB, VML, ReML, and ML, ﬁrst in an exemplary setting and then in the analysis of experimental fMRI data acquired from a single participant under visual stimulation.},

	abstract = {“Decisions from experience” (DFE) refers to a body of work that emerged in research on behavioral decision making over the last decade. One of the major experimental paradigms employed to study experience-based choice is the “sampling paradigm,” which serves as a model of decision making under limited knowledge about the statistical structure of the world. In this paradigm respondents are presented with two payoff distributions, which, in contrast to standard approaches in behavioral economics, are speciﬁed not in terms of explicit outcome-probability information, but by the opportunity to sample outcomes from each distribution without economic consequences. Participants are encouraged to explore the distributions until they feel conﬁdent enough to decide from which they would prefer to draw from in a ﬁnal trial involving real monetary payoffs. One commonly employed measure to characterize the behavior of participants in the sampling paradigm is the sample size, that is, the number of outcome draws which participants choose to obtain from each distribution prior to terminating sampling. A natural question that arises in this context concerns the “optimal” sample size, which could be used as a normative benchmark to evaluate human sampling behavior in DFE. In this theoretical study, we relate the DFE sampling paradigm to the classical statistical decision theoretic literature and, under a probabilistic inference assumption, evaluate optimal sample sizes for DFE. In our treatment we go beyond analytically established results by showing how the classical statistical decision theoretic framework can be used to derive optimal sample sizes under arbitrary, but numerically evaluable, constraints. Finally, we critically evaluate the value of deriving optimal sample sizes under this framework as testable predictions for the experimental study of sampling behavior in DFE.},

	abstract = {Constructing mental representations in the absence of sensory stimulation is a fundamental ability of the human mind and has been investigated in numerous brain imaging studies. However, it is still unclear how brain areas facilitating mental construction processes interact with brain regions related to speciﬁc sensory representations. In this fMRI study subjects formed mental representations of tactile stimuli either from memory (imagery) or from presentation of actual corresponding vibrotactile patterned stimuli. First our analysis addressed the question of whether tactile imagery recruits primary somatosensory cortex (SI), because the activation of early perceptual areas is classically interpreted as perceptual grounding of the mental image. We also tested whether a network, referred to as ‘core construction system’, is involved in the generation of mental representations in the somatosensory domain. In fact, we observed imagery-induced activation of SI. We further found support for the notion of a modality independent construction network with the retrosplenial cortices and the precuneus as core components, which were supplemented with the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Finally, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed robust imagery-modulated changes in the connectivity of these construction related areas, which suggests that they orchestrate the assembly of an abstract mental representation. Interestingly, we found increased coupling between prefrontal cortex (left IFG) and SI during mental imagery, indicating the augmentation of an abstract mental representation by reactivating perceptually grounded sensory details.},

Identifying network interaction from the complementary neuroelectric and hemodynamic signals may help to explain the complex relationships between different brain regions. In this paper, multimodal functional network connectivity (mFNC) is proposed for the fusion of EEG and fMRI in network space. First, functional networks (FNs) are extracted using spatial independent component analysis (ICA) in each modality separately. Then the interactions among FNs in each modality are explored by Granger causality analysis (GCA). Finally, fMRI FNs are matched to EEG FNs in the spatial domain using networkbased source imaging (NESOI). Investigations of both synthetic and real data demonstrate that mFNC has the potential to reveal the underlying neural networks of each modality separately and in their combination. With mFNC, comprehensive relationships among FNs might be unveiled for the deep exploration of neural activities and metabolic responses in a specific task or neurological state.},

It thus has the potential to unveil important signal characteristics overlooked by classical data analysis techniques. In this review, we discuss how information theoretic concepts have been applied to the analysis of functional brain imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and magneto/electroencephalography. We review studies from a number of imaging domains, including the investigation of the brain's functional specialization and integration, neurovascular coupling and multimodal imaging. We demonstrate how information theoretical concepts can be used to answer neurobiological questions and discuss their limitations as well as possible future developments of the framework to advance our understanding of brain function.},

Cortical processing of the NT stimuli was studied indirectly by investigating the impact of NT stimuli on the source activity of succeeding suprathreshold test stimuli. We hypothesized that cortical responses evoked by test stimuli are reduced due to the preactivation of the same ﬁnger representation by the preceding NT stimulus. We observed attenuation of the magnetic responses in the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex, with stronger decreases for perceived than for missed NT stimuli. Our data suggest that processing in the primary somatosensory cortex including recovery lasts for o200 ms. Conversely, the occupancy of SII lasts !500 ms, which points to its role in temporal integration and conscious perception of sensory input.},

Corticosteroids are known to influence hippocampal structure and function; specifically, plasma corticosteroid levels have been inversely correlated with hippocampal cell proliferation, cell death, and impaired memory function. The relationship between corticosteroids and structure and function of the hippocampus has been studied in experimental systems in adult animals by increasing or decreasing corticosterone levels through pharmacological supplementation and through surgical removal of the adrenal gland. Here, we utilized the genetically engineered pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) null mutant mouse, which because of the lack of all POMC peptides has no corticosterone from birth throughout life. The effect of this lifelong absence of corticosterone on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is a decrease in granule cell density, which correlated with a decrease in cell proliferation but not an increase in cell degeneration. Fine morphology of granule cells was unaltered. Analyses of gene expression revealed no changes in POMC null mutant vs wild-type hippocampus with respect to levels of expression of corticoid receptor genes or genes known to be regulated by corticosterone. Spatial learning as tested by the Morris water maze was not altered in the POMC null mutant mouse. Taken together with findings from other studies of the effects of altered levels of corticosteroids on the hippocampus, our results argue for a complex homeostasis in which disturbances of any one factor can offset the system in varying ways.},

	abstract = {Dynamic causal models” (DCMs) are a promising approach in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data due to their biophysical interpretability and their consolidation of functional-segregative and functional-integrative propositions. In this theoretical note we are concerned with the DCM framework for electroencephalographically recorded event-related potentials (ERP-DCM). Intuitively, ERP-DCM combines deterministic dynamical neural mass models with dipole-based EEG forward models to describe the event-related scalp potential time-series over the entire electrode space. Since its inception, ERP-DCM has been successfully employed to capture the neural underpinnings of a wide range of neurocognitive phenomena. However, in spite of its empirical popularity, the technical literature on ERP-DCM remains somewhat patchy. A number of previous communications have detailed certain aspects of the approach, but no uniﬁed and coherent documentation exists. With this technical note, we aim to close this gap and to increase the technical accessibility of ERP-DCM. Speciﬁcally, this note makes the following novel contributions: ﬁrstly, we provide a uniﬁed and coherent review of the mathematical machinery of the latent and forward models constituting ERP-DCM by formulating the approach as a probabilistic latent delay differential equation model. Secondly, we emphasize the probabilistic nature of the model and its variational Bayesian inversion scheme by explicitly deriving the variational free energy function in terms of both the likelihood expectation and variance parameters. Thirdly, we detail and validate the estimation of the model with a special focus on the explicit form of the variational free energy function and introduce a conventional nonlinear optimization scheme for its maximization. Finally, we identify and discuss a number of computational issues which may be addressed in the future development of the approach.},

	abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the relationship between positive BOLD responses (PBRs) and negative BOLD responses (NBRs) to stimulation is potentially informative about the balance of excitatory and inhibitory brain responses in sensory cortex. In this study, we performed three separate experiments delivering visual, motor or somatosensory stimulation unilaterally, to one side of the sensory ﬁeld, to induce PBR and NBR in opposite brain hemispheres. We then assessed the relationship between the evoked amplitudes of contralateral PBR and ipsilateral NBR at the level of both single-trial and average responses. We measure single-trial PBR and NBR peak amplitudes from individual time-courses, and show that they were positively correlated in all experiments. In contrast, in the average response across trials the absolute magnitudes of both PBR and NBR increased with increasing stimulus intensity, resulting in a negative correlation between mean response amplitudes. Subsequent analysis showed that the amplitude of single-trial PBR was positively correlated with the BOLD response across all grey-matter voxels and was not speciﬁcally related to the ipsilateral sensory cortical response. We demonstrate that the global component of this single-trial response modulation could be fully explained by voxelwise vascular reactivity, the BOLD signal standard deviation measured in a separate resting-state scan (resting state ﬂuctuation amplitude, RSFA). However, bilateral positive correlation between PBR and NBR regions remained. We further report that modulations in the global brain fMRI signal cannot fully account for this positive PBR–NBR coupling and conclude that the local sensory network response reﬂects a combination of superimposed vascular and neuronal signals. More detailed quantiﬁcation of physiological and noise contributions to the BOLD signal is required to fully understand the trial-by-trial PBR and NBR relationship compared with that of average responses.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether previously reported early blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in epilepsy could occur as a result of the modelling techniques rather than physiological changes.
Methods: EEG-fMRI data were analysed from seven patients with focal epilepsy, six control subjects undergoing a visual experiment, in addition to simulations. In six separate analyses the event timing was shifted by either À9,À6,À3,+3,+6 or +9 s relative to the onset of the interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) or stimulus.
Results: The visual dataset and simulations demonstrated an overlap between modelled haemodynamic response function (HRF) at event onset and at ±3 s relative to onset, which diminished at ±6 s. Pre-spike analysis at À6 s improved concordance with the assumed IED generating lobe relative to the standard HRF in 43\% of patients.
Conclusion: The visual and simulated dataset ﬁndings indicate a form of ‘‘temporal bleeding’’, an overlap between the modelled HRF at time 0 and at ±3 s which attenuated at ±6 s. Pre-spike analysis at À6 s may improve concordance.},

	abstract = {Alerting, orienting, and executive control are widely thought to be relatively independent aspects of attention that are linked to separable brain regions. However, neuroimaging studies have yet to examine evidence for the anatomical separability of these three aspects of attention in the same subjects performing the same task. The attention network test (ANT) examines the effects of cues and targets within a single reaction time task to provide a means of exploring the efficiency of the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks involved in attention. It also provides an opportunity to examine the brain activity of these three networks as they operate in a single integrated task. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the brain areas involved in the three attention systems targeted by the ANT. The alerting contrast showed strong thalamic involvement and activation of anterior and posterior cortical sites. As expected, the orienting contrast activated parietal sites and frontal eye fields. The executive control network contrast showed activation of the anterior cingulate along with several other brain areas. With some exceptions, activation patterns of these three networks within this single task are consistent with previous fMRI studies that have been studied in separate tasks. Overall, the fMRI results suggest that the functional contrasts within this single task differentially activate three separable anatomical networks related to the components of attention.},

Since that time the process of discovery has evolved to make use of new technologies and methods in a changing regulatory and social environment. The Sackler Colloquium “Reproducibility of Research: Issues and Proposed Remedies,” which took place on March 8–10, 2017, convened a wide range of research community stakeholders to address our understanding of transparency and reproducibility in the modern research context with two related questions: what does reproducibility mean in different research contexts, and what remedies increase reproducibility and transparency?

We approach the topic of reproducibility with sensitivity to its complexity, spanning a wide range of issues from data collection and reporting to communication of scientific findings by scientists and nonscientists alike. The Colloquium was organized by David Allison, Richard Shiffrin, Victoria Stodden, and Stephen Fienberg. Before the Colloquium our esteemed and respected friend and colleague, Stephen Fienberg, unfortunately died and could not witness the outcome of his vision. A PNAS retrospective by Larry Wasserman describes Stephen’s extraordinary career (2).

	abstract = {Achieving a mechanistic explanation of brain function requires understanding causal relationships among regions. A relatively new technique to assess effective connectivity in fMRI data is Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). As DCM is more frequently used, it becomes increasingly important to further validate the technique and understand its limitations. With DCM, Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) is used to select the most likely causal model. We conducted simulations to test the degree to which BMS is robust to two types of challenges when applied to DCMs, those inherent to data (Category 1) and those inherent to model space (Category 2). Category 1 challenges tested properties of the data (low signal-to-noise, different response magnitudes and shapes across regions) that could either blur the distinction between models or potentially bias model selection. These challenges are impossible or difficult to measure and control in real data, so investigating their effect upon BMS through simulation is critical. Category 2 challenges tested properties of model space that create subsets of confusable models. Our results suggest that given data that conform to the prior assumptions of DCM, BMS is robust to challenges from Category 1. However, in the face of Category 2 challenges (when a more homogenous model space was tested) the false positive rate rose above an acceptable level. We show that such errors are neither trivial nor easily avoided with existing approaches. However, we argue that it is possible to detect Category 2 challenges, and avoid inappropriate interpretations by conducting simulations prior to applying DCM.},

	abstract = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.  Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

[1994]: Nature 392:543–546; Mangun et al. [1997]: Hum Brain Mapp 5:273–279). Neural activations in extrastriate cortex were observed in the PET measures for attended stimuli, and these effects were related to attentional modulations in the ERPs at speciﬁc latencies. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ERPs in single subjects to investigate the intersubject variability in extrastriate spatial attention effects, and to qualitatively compare this to variations in ERP attention effects. Activations in single subjects replicated our prior group-averaged PET ﬁndings, showing attention-related increases in blood ﬂow in the posterior fusiform and middle occipital gyri in the hemisphere contralateral to attended visual stimuli. All subjects showed attentional modulations of the occipital P1 component of the ERPs. These ﬁndings in single subjects demonstrate the consistency of extrastriate attention effects, and provide information about the feasibility of this approach for integration of electrical and functional imaging data.

Source modelling combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowed localisation of six SEF sources on the outer aspect of the hemispheres located respectively: (1) in the posterior bank of the rolandic ﬁssure (area SI), the upper bank of the sylvian ﬁssure (parietal opercular area SII) and the banks of the intraparietal ﬁssure contralateral to stimulation, (2) in the SII area ipsilateral to stimulation and (3) in the mid-frontal or inferior frontal gyri on both sides. All source areas were found to be simultaneously active at 70–140 ms after the stimulus, the SI source was the only one active already at 20–60 ms. The observed activation timing suggests that somatosensory input from SI is processed to higher-order areas through serial feedforward projections. However the long-lasting activations of all sources and their overlap in time is also compatible with a top-down control mediated via backward projections. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Luminance contrast is the basis of text legibility, and maintaining luminance contrast is essential for any colour selection algorithm. In principle, it can be calculated precisely on a sufﬁciently well calibrated display surface, but calibration is very expensive. Consequently, most current systems deal with contrast using heuristics. However, the usual CRT set-up puts the display surface into a state that is relatively predictable. Luminance values can be estimated based on this state, and these luminance values used to calculate contrast using the Michelson deﬁnition. This paper proposes a method for determining the contrast of coloured areas displayed on a CRT. It uses a contrast metric that is in wide use in visual psychophysics, and shows that the metric can be approximated reasonably without display measurement, as long as it is possible to assume that the CRT has been adjusted according to usual CRT set-up standards.},

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simpliﬁed graphical model in which inference is efﬁcient. Inference in the simpiﬁed model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case.},

This macroscopic field theory is derived from the quasi-microscopic conversion properties of neural populations occurring at synapses and somas. The quasi-microscopic models by Wilson-Cowan (1972,1973) and Nunez (1974) can be derived from these. Functional units are treated as inhomogeneities within a nonlinear one-dimensional neural tissue. Second, for the case of the Kelso experiment the field equation is treated analytically and numerically and can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations which corresponds to a model by Jirsa et al. (1994,1995). This phenomenological model reproduces the spatio-temporal phenomena experimentally observed. Here the most prominent property of the neural tissue is the parametric excitation. The macroscopic field parameters can be expressed by quasi-microscopic neural parameters.},

	abstract = {Objective: Mutual information provides a measure of both the linear and nonlinear statistical dependencies between two time series. Cross-mutual information (CMI) is used to quantify the information transmitted from one time series to another, while auto mutual information (AMI) in a time series estimates how much on average the value of the time series can be predicted from values of the time series at preceding points. The aim of this study is to assess information transmission between different cortical areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients by estimating the average CMI between EEG electrodes.
Methods: We recorded the EEG from 16 scale electrodes in 15 AD patients and 15 age-matched normal controls, and estimated the local, distant, and interhemispheric CMIs of the EEG in both groups. The rate of decrease (with increasing delay) of the AMI of the EEG was also measured to evaluate the complexity of the EEG in AD patients.
Results: The local CMI in AD subjects was lower than that in normal controls, especially over frontal and antero-temporal regions. A prominent decrease in information transmission between distant electrodes in the right hemisphere and between corresponding interhemispheric electrodes was detected in the AD patients. In addition, the AMIs throughout the cerebrums of the AD patients decreased signi®cantly more slowly with delay than did the AMIs of normal controls.
Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous ®ndings that suggest the association of EEG abnormalities in AD patients with functional impairment of information transmission in long cortico-cortical connections. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Most models of RL assume that the dopaminergic prediction error signal drives plasticity in frontal–striatal circuits. The striatum then encodes value representations that drive decision processes. However, the amygdala has also been shown to play an important role in forming Pavlovian stimulus–outcome associations. These Pavlovian associations can drive motivated behavior via the amygdala projections to the ventral striatum or the ventral tegmental area. The amygdala may, therefore, play a central role in RL. Here we compare the contributions of the amygdala and the striatum to RL and show that both the amygdala and striatum learn and represent expected values in RL tasks. Furthermore, value representations in the striatum may be inherited, to some extent, from the amygdala. The striatum may, therefore, play less of a primary role in learning stimulus–outcome associations in RL than previously suggested.},

	abstract = {We derive a family of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods for agents, who face sequential decision-making tasks in uncertain environments. By applying a utility function to the temporal difference (TD) error, nonlinear transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents’ behaviors express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman \& Tversky, 1979), for example, different risk preferences for gains and losses, as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence. As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework, we apply it to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find that the risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses that is indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured fMRI signals shows a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with BOLD signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the striatum, cingulate cortex, and insula that is not present if standard Q-values are used.},

	abstract = {We analyzed factors that may hamper the advancement of computational cognitive neuroscience (CCN). These factors include a particular statistical mindset, which paves the way for the dominance of statistical power theory and a preoccupation with statistical replicability in the behavioral and neural sciences. Exclusive statistical concerns about sampling error occur at the cost of an inadequate representation of the problem of measurement error. We contrasted the manipulation of data quantity (sampling error, by varying the number of subjects) against the manipulation of data quality (measurement error, by varying the number of data per subject) in a simulated Bayesian model identifiability study. The results were clear-cut in showing that - across all levels of signal-to-noise ratios - varying the number of subjects was completely inconsequential, whereas the number of data per subject exerted massive effects on model identifiability. These results emphasize data quality over data quantity, and they call for the integration of statistics and measurement theory.},

In such conditions, human choices resemble optimal Bayesian inference, but typically show a large suboptimal variability whose origin remains poorly understood. In particular, this choice suboptimality might arise from imperfections in mental inference rather than in peripheral stages, such as sensory processing and response selection. Here, we dissociate these three sources of suboptimality in human choices based on combining multiple ambiguous cues. Using a novel quantitative approach for identifying the origin and structure of choice variability, we show that imperfections in inference alone cause a dominant fraction of suboptimal choices. Furthermore, two-thirds of this suboptimality appear to derive from the limited precision of neural computations implementing inference rather than from systematic deviations from Bayes-optimal inference. These ﬁndings set an upper bound on the accuracy and ultimate predictability of human choices in uncertain environments.},

(2009), where models are treated as random effects that could differ between subjects, with an unknown population distribution. Here, we extend this work, by (i) introducing the Bayesian omnibus risk (BOR) as a measure of the statistical risk incurred when performing group BMS, (ii) highlighting the difference between random effects BMS and classical random effects analyses of parameter estimates, and (iii) addressing the problem of between group or condition model comparisons. We address the first issue by quantifying the chance likelihood of apparent differences in model frequencies. This leads to the notion of protected exceedance probabilities. The second issue arises when people want to ask “whether a model parameter is zero or not” at the group level. Here, we provide guidance as to whether to use a classical second-level analysis of parameter estimates, or random effects BMS. The third issue rests on the evidence for a difference in model labels or frequencies across groups or conditions. Overall, we hope that the material presented in this paper finesses the problems of group-level BMS in the analysis of neuroimaging and behavioural data.},

However, a central question remains: How to specify an expressive variational distribution that maintains efﬁcient computation? To address this, we develop hierarchical variational models (HVMs). HVMs augment a variational approximation with a prior on its parameters, which allows it to capture complex structure for both discrete and continuous latent variables. The algorithm we develop is black box, can be used for any HVM, and has the same computational efﬁciency as the original approximation. We study HVMs on a variety of deep discrete latent variable models. HVMs generalize other expressive variational distributions and maintains higher ﬁdelity to the posterior.},

Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-ﬁeld or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.},

	abstract = {In Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI)-based MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), inter-subject registration typically uses the subject's T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical image to learn deformations of the subject's brain onto a template. The estimated deformation fields are then applied to the subject's EPI scans (functional or diffusion-weighted images) to warp the latter to a template space. Historically, such indirect T1w-based registration was motivated by the lack of clear anatomical details in low-resolution EPI images: a direct registration of the EPI scans to template space would be futile. A central prerequisite in such indirect methods is that the anatomical (aka the T1w) image of each subject is well aligned with their EPI images via rigid coregistration. We provide experimental evidence that things have changed: nowadays, there is a decent amount of anatomical contrast in high-resolution EPI data. That notwithstanding, EPI distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities cannot be fully corrected. Residual uncorrected distortions induce non-rigid deformations between the EPI scans and the same subject's anatomical scan. In this manuscript, we contribute a computationally cheap pipeline that leverages the high spatial resolution of modern EPI scans for direct inter-subject matching. Our pipeline is direct and does not rely on the T1w scan to estimate the inter-subject deformation. Results on a large dataset show that this new pipeline outperforms the classical indirect T1w-based registration scheme, across a variety of post-registration quality-assessment metrics including: Normalized Mutual Information, relative variance (variance-to-mean ratio), and to a lesser extent, improved peaks of group-level General Linear Model (GLM) activation maps.},

	abstract = {Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported sex differences. To empirically evaluate for evidence of excessive significance bias in this literature, we searched for published fMRI studies of human brain to evaluate sex differences, regardless of the topic investigated, in Medline and Scopus over 10 years. We analyzed the prevalence of conclusions in favor of sex differences and the correlation between study sample sizes and number of significant foci identified. In the absence of bias, larger studies (better powered) should identify a larger number of significant foci. Across 179 papers, median sample size was n = 32 (interquartile range 23-47.5). A median of 5 foci related to sex differences were reported (interquartile range, 2-9.5). Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes. Overall, 158 papers (88\%) reached “positive” conclusions in their abstract and presented some foci related to sex differences. There was no statistically significant relationship between sample size and the number of foci (−0.048\% increase for every 10 participants, p = 0.63). The extremely high prevalence of “positive” results and the lack of the expected relationship between sample size and the number of discovered foci reflect probable reporting bias and excess significance bias in this literature.},

	abstract = {We introduce Lipschitz-Killing curvature (LKC) regression, a new method to produce \$(1-{\textbackslash}alpha)\$ thresholds for signal detection in random fields that does not require knowledge of the spatial correlation structure. The idea is to fit observed empirical Euler characteristics to the Gaussian kinematic formula via generalized least squares, which quickly and easily provides statistical estimates of the LKCs --- complex topological quantities that can be extremely challenging to compute, both theoretically and numerically. With these estimates, we can then make use of a powerful parametric approximation via Euler characteristics for Gaussian random fields to generate accurate \$(1-{\textbackslash}alpha)\$ thresholds and \$p\$-values. The main features of our proposed LKC regression method are easy implementation, conceptual simplicity, and facilitated diagnostics, which we demonstrate in a variety of simulations and applications.},

	abstract = {A core goal of auditory neuroscience is to build quantitative models that predict cortical responses to natural sounds. Reasoning that a complete model of auditory cortex must solve ecologically relevant tasks, we optimized hierarchical neural networks for speech and music recognition. The best-performing network contained separate music and speech pathways following early shared processing, potentially replicating human cortical organization. The network performed both tasks as well as humans and exhibited human-like errors despite not being optimized to do so, suggesting common constraints on network and human performance. The network predicted fMRI voxel responses substantially better than traditional spectrotemporal ﬁlter models throughout auditory cortex. It also provided a quantitative signature of cortical representational hierarchy—primary and non-primary responses were best predicted by intermediate and late network layers, respectively. The results suggest that task optimization provides a powerful set of tools for modeling sensory systems.},

As neuroimaging technologies become more widely available, they are increasingly being applied by the wider neuroscience community. However, concerns have recently been raised that the conclusions drawn from many human neuroimaging studies are either spurious or not generalizable. Problems such as low statistical power, analytical flexibility, and lack of direct replication apply to many fields, but perhaps particularly to neuroimaging. In this O pinion article, we discuss these problems, outline current and suggested best practices to improve the quality and reproducibility of neuroimaging findings, and describe how we think the field should evolve if it is to produce the most meaningful answers to current and future research questions.},

	abstract = {The integration of signals from electro-encephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), acquired simultaneously from the same observer, holds great potential for the elucidation of the neurobiological underpinnings of human brain function. However, the most appropriate way in which to combine the data in order to achieve this goal is not clear. Here, we apply a novel route to the integration of simultaneously acquired multimodal brain imaging data. We adopt a theoretical framework developed in the study of neuronal population codes which explicitly takes into account the experimentally observed stimulus–response signal probability distributions using the concept of mutual information. We study the implications of this framework using simulated data sets generated from a set of linear Gaussian models, and apply the framework to EEG–fMRI data acquired during checkerboard stimulation of low and high contrast. We focus our evaluation on single-trial time-domain signal features from both modalities and provide evidence for the informativeness of a subset of these features with respect to the stimulus and each other. Speciﬁcally, the framework was able to identify the contrast dependency of the haemodynamic response and the P100 peak of the visual evoked potential, and showed that combining EEG and fMRI time-domain features by quantifying the information in their joint distribution was more informative than treating each one in isolation. In addition, the effect of different pre-processing strategies for EEG-fMRI data can be assessed quantitatively, indicating the improvements to be gained by more advanced methods. We conclude that the information theoretic framework is a promising methodology to quantify the relative importance of different response features in neural coding and neurovascular coupling, as well as the success of data pre-processing strategies.},

Museums benefit from critical help in collections care and an increased intellectual vitality, while students simultaneously gain essential research skills and an unparalleled exposure to biodiversity. Five first steps to creating a program are: dedicate a coordinator, offer credit, diversify participation, create a tiered structure, and build community.},

Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extending the standard Baum-Welch (forward-backward) algorithm, we derive an efﬁcient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the ﬁrst application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can be used to automatically identify repeated strokes that represent combination of letters in cursive handwriting.},

By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identiﬁcation of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of ﬁltering, noisy channel identiﬁcation, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a family of unsupervised learning algorithms that have proven useful for the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). ICA decomposes an EEG/MEG data set into a basis of maximally temporally independent components (ICs) that are learned from the data. As with any statistic, a concern with using ICA is the degree to which the estimated ICs are reliable. An IC may not be reliable if ICA was trained on insufﬁcient data, if ICA training was stopped prematurely or at a local minimum (for some algorithms), or if multiple global minima were present. Consequently, evidence of ICA reliability is critical for the credibility of ICA results. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for assessing the reliability of ICs based on applying ICA separately to split-halves of a data set. This algorithm improves upon existing methods in that it considers both IC scalp topographies and activations, uses a probabilistically interpretable threshold for accepting ICs as reliable, and requires applying ICA only three times per data set. As evidence of the method's validity, we show that the method can perform comparably to more time intensive bootstrap resampling and depends in a reasonable manner on the amount of training data. Finally, using the method we illustrate the importance of checking the reliability of ICs by demonstrating that IC reliability is dramatically increased by removing the mean EEG at each channel for each epoch of data rather than the mean EEG in a prestimulus baseline.},

We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition ‘dipolarity’ defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonlyused decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partiallysynchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).},

	abstract = {Predictive coding (PC) posits that the brain employs a generative model to infer the environmental causes of its sensory data and uses precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPE) to continuously update this model. While supported by much circumstantial evidence, experimental tests grounded in formal trial-by-trial predictions are rare. One partial exception are event-related potential (ERP) studies of the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), where computational models have found signatures of pwPEs and related model-updating processes.
Here, we tested this hypothesis in the visual domain, examining possible links between visual mismatch responses and pwPEs. We used a novel visual ‘roving standard' paradigm to elicit mismatch responses in humans (of both sexes) by unexpected changes in either color or emotional expression of faces. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we simulated pwPE trajectories of a Bayes-optimal observer and used these to conduct a comprehensive trial-by-trial analysis across the time×sensor space. We found significant modulation of brain activity by both color and emotion pwPEs. The scalp distribution and timing of these single-trial pwPE responses were in agreement with visual mismatch responses obtained by traditional averaging and subtraction (deviant-minus-standard) approaches. Finally, we compared the Bayesian model to a more classical change detection (CD) model of MMN. Model comparison revealed that trial-wise pwPEs explained the observed mismatch responses better than categorical change detection.
Our results suggest that visual mismatch responses reflect trial-wise pwPEs, as postulated by PC. These findings go beyond classical ERP analyses of visual mismatch and illustrate the utility of computational analyses for studying automatic perceptual processes.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Human perception is thought to rely on a predictive model of the environment which is updated via precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPE) when events violate expectations. This “predictive coding” view is supported by studies of the auditory mismatch negativity brain potential. However, it is less well known whether visual perception of mismatch relies on similar processes. Here we combined computational modeling and electroencephalography to test whether visual mismatch responses reflected trial-by-trial pwPEs. Applying a Bayesian model to series of face stimuli that violated expectations about color or emotional expression, we found significant modulation of brain activity by both color and emotion pwPEs. A categorical change detection model performed less convincingly. Our findings support the predictive coding interpretation of visual mismatch responses.},

	abstract = {Objective: The choice of electroencephalograph (EEG) reference is a critical issue for the study of brain activity. The present study addressed the use of the inﬁnity reference obtained by the reference electrode standardisation technique (REST) in the study of EEG default mode network (DMN).
Methods: A total of 100 randomly positioned source conﬁgurations, each consisting of two dipoles with coherent waveforms, were adopted for simulating EEG networks. Dense (129-channel), eyes-closed EEG was recorded from 15 subjects. Simulated data with inﬁnity as reference and the real data were re-referenced to reconstructed inﬁnity (REST), their average (AR), linked mastoids (LM) and left mastoid (L) references. For simulated data, the effects of different references on coherence and network were investigated. For real data, spectral properties of seven conventional EEG frequency bands were ﬁrst analysed and then DMN was constructed based on the coherence.
Results: The simulation showed that REST can exactly recover the true EEG network conﬁguration. For real EEG data, signiﬁcant differences among references were found for the power spectra, coherence and DMN conﬁguration. Compared with REST, the long-distance connectivity between anterior and posterior areas was strengthened by AR, and the connectivity over posterior areas was destroyed when LM and L were employed. Moreover, all comparisons demonstrated frequency-dependent reference effects.
Conclusions: Non-neutral reference inﬂuences the power spectra, coherence as well as the network analysis. REST demonstrates its validity in data referencing, and meanwhile, AR is much closer to REST than the other references in terms of spectra and coherence. However, the DMN alters a great deal with AR. Signiﬁcance: The results underscore the importance of considering EEG reference effects in the functional connectivity studies. REST is a promising reference technique for objective comparison in cross-laboratory studies and clinical practices.},

Common experimental paradigms for addressing these questions involve the measurement and/or comparison of backward-masking (or rapid serial visual presentation) psychometric functions and of physiological EEG/MEG/LFP signals (peak latencies, differential activities, single-trial decoding techniques). I review and illustrate four common mistakes that scientists tend to make when using these paradigms, and explain the conceptual fallacies that motivate their reasoning. First, contrary to collective intuition, presentation times, or stimulus-onset asynchrony masking thresholds cannot be taken to reﬂect, directly or indirectly, the timing of relevant brain processes. Second, psychophysical or electrophysiological measurements should not be compared without assessing potential physical differences between experimental stimulus sets. Third, such comparisons should not be performed in any manner contingent on subjective responses, so as to avoid response biases. Last, the ﬁltering of electrophysiological signals alters their temporal structure, and thus precludes their interpretation in terms of time course. Practical solutions are proposed to overcome these common mistakes.},

	abstract = {The event-related potential (ERP) and event-related ﬁeld (ERF) techniques provide valuable insights into the time course of processes in the brain. Because neural signals are typically weak, researchers commonly ﬁlter the data to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. However, ﬁltering may distort the data, leading to false results. Using our own EEG data, we show that acausal high-pass ﬁltering can generate a systematic bias easily leading to misinterpretations of neural activity. In particular, we show that the early ERP component C1 is very sensitive to such effects. Moreover, we found that about half of the papers reporting modulations in the C1 range used a high-pass digital ﬁlter cut-off above the recommended maximum of 0.1 Hz. More generally, among 185 relevant ERP/ERF publications, 80 used cutoffs above 0.1 Hz. As a consequence, part of the ERP/ERF literature may need to be re-analyzed. We provide guidelines on how to minimize ﬁltering artifacts.},

	abstract = {Background: Filtering is a ubiquitous step in the preprocessing of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of signal components considered as noise, ﬁltering can also result in various unintended adverse ﬁlter effects (distortions such as smoothing) and ﬁlter artifacts.
Method: We give some practical guidelines for the evaluation of ﬁlter responses (impulse and frequency response) and the selection of ﬁlter types (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; ﬁnite/inﬁnite impulse response, FIR/IIR) and ﬁlter parameters (cutoff frequencies, ﬁlter order and roll-off, ripple, delay and causality) to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal distortions for selected electrophysiological applications.
Results: Various ﬁlter implementations in common electrophysiology software packages are introduced and discussed. Resulting ﬁlter responses are compared and evaluated.
Conclusion: We present strategies for recognizing common adverse ﬁlter effects and ﬁlter artifacts and demonstrate them in practical examples. Best practices and recommendations for the selection and reporting of ﬁlter parameters, limitations, and alternatives to ﬁltering are discussed.},

	abstract = {Although it is widely known that high-pass filters can reduce the amplitude of slow ERP components, these filters can also introduce artifactual peaks that lead to incorrect conclusions. To demonstrate this and provide evidence about optimal filter settings, we recorded ERPs in a typical language processing paradigm involving syntactic and semantic violations. Unfiltered results showed standard N400 and P600 effects in the semantic and syntactic violation conditions, respectively. However, high-pass filters with cutoffs at 0.3 Hz and above produced artifactual effects of opposite polarity before the true effect. That is, excessive high-pass filtering introduced a significant N400 effect preceding the P600 in the syntactic condition, and a significant P2 effect preceding the N400 in the semantic condition. Thus, inappropriate use of high-pass filters can lead to false conclusions about which components are influenced by a given manipulation. The present results also lead to practical recommendations for high-pass filter settings that maximize statistical power while minimizing filtering artifacts.},

	abstract = {Numerous functionally distinct regions of cortex (e.g., V1, MT, the fusiform face area) can be easily identified in any normal human subject in just a few minutes of fMRI scanning. However, the locations of these regions vary across subjects. Investigations of these regions have therefore often used a functional region of interest (fROI) approach in which the region is first identified functionally in each subject individually, before subsequent scans in the same subjects test specific hypotheses concerning that region. This fROI method, which resembled long-established practice in visual neurophysiology, has methodological, statistical, and theoretical advantages over standard alternatives (such as whole-brain analyses of group data): (i) because functional properties are more consistently and robustly associated with fROIs than with locations in stereotaxic space, functional hypotheses concerning fROIs are often the most straightforward to frame, motivate, and test, (ii) because hypotheses are tested in only a handful of fROIs (instead of in tens of thousands of voxels), advance specification of fROIs provides a massive increase in statistical power over whole-brain analyses, and (iii) some fROIs may serve as candidate distinct components of the mind/brain worth investigation as such. Of course fROIs can be productively used in conjunction with other complementary methods. Here, we explain the motivation for and advantages of the fROI approach, and we rebut the criticism of this method offered by Friston et al.

	abstract = {We present an eﬃcient procedure for estimating the marginal likelihood of probabilistic models with latent variables or incomplete data. This method constructs and optimises a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using variational calculus, resulting in an iterative algorithm which generalises the EM algorithm by maintaining posterior distributions over both latent variables and parameters. We deﬁne the family of conjugate-exponential models—which includes ﬁnite mixtures of exponential family models, factor analysis, hidden Markov models, linear state-space models, and other models of interest—for which this bound on the marginal likelihood can be computed very simply through a modiﬁcation of the standard EM algorithm. In particular, we focus on applying these bounds to the problem of scoring discrete directed graphical model structures (Bayesian networks). Extensive simulations comparing the variational bounds to the usual approach based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and to a sampling-based gold standard method known as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) show that variational bounds substantially outperform BIC in ﬁnding the correct model structure at relatively little computational cost, while approaching the performance of the much more costly AIS procedure. Using AIS allows us to provide the ﬁrst serious case study of the tightness of variational bounds. We also analyse the perfomance of AIS through a variety of criteria, discuss the use of other variational approaches to estimating marginal likelihoods based on Bethe and Kikuchi approximations, and outline directions in which this work can be extended.},

	abstract = {Mathematical statistics uses two major paradigms, conventional (or frequentist), and Bayesian. Bayesian methods provide a complete paradigm for both statistical inference and decision making under uncertainty. Bayesian methods may be derived from an axiomatic system, and hence provide a general, coherent methodology. Bayesian methods contain as particular cases many of the more often used frequentist procedures, solve many of the difﬁculties faced by conventional statistical methods, and extend the applicability of statistical methods. In particular, Bayesian methods make it possible to incorporate scientiﬁc hypothesis in the analysis (by means of the prior distribution) and may be applied to problems whose structure is too complex for conventional methods to be able to handle. The Bayesian paradigm is based on an interpretation of probability as a rational, conditional measure of uncertainty, which closely matches the sense of the word ‘probability’ in ordinary language. Statistical inference about a quantity of interest is described as the modiﬁcation of the uncertainty about its value in the light of evidence, and Bayes’ theorem precisely speciﬁes how this modiﬁcation should be made. The special situation, often met in scientiﬁc reporting and public decision making, where the only acceptable information is that which may be deduced from available documented data, is addressed by objective Bayesian methods, as a particular case.},

	abstract = {Cluster-size tests (CSTs) based on random ﬁeld theory (RFT) are commonly adopted to identify signiﬁcant differences in brain images. However, the use of RFT in CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When images are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false positives in smooth regions and reduced power in rough regions. An adjustment to the cluster size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been proposed for the standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however, this technique requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large degrees of freedom and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a voxelation-corrected 3D CST based on Gaussian random ﬁeld theory that does not place constraints on the degree of spatial smoothness. However, this approach is only applicable to stationary images, requiring further modiﬁcation to enable use for non-stationary images. In this study, we present modiﬁcations of this method to develop a voxelation-corrected non-stationary 3D CST based on RFT. Both simulated and real data were used to compare the voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST to the standard clustersize adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We found that voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images and the voxelation-corrected nonstationary CST performs better than cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity threshold and low degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the early 2010s, the neuroimaging ﬁeld has paid more attention to the issue of false positives. Several journals have issued guidelines regarding statistical thresholds. Three papers have reported the statistical analysis of the thresholds used in fMRI literature, but they were published at least 3 years ago and surveyed papers published during 2007–2012. This study revisited this topic to evaluate the changes in this ﬁeld.
Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify the task-based (not resting-state) fMRI papers published in 2017 and record their sample sizes, inferential methods (e.g., voxelwise or clusterwise), theoretical methods (e.g., parametric or non-parametric), signiﬁcance level, cluster-deﬁning primary threshold (CDT), volume of analysis (whole brain or region of interest) and software used.
Results: The majority (95.6\%) of the 388 analyzed articles reported statistics corrected for multiple comparisons. A large proportion (69.6\%) of the 388 articles reported main results by clusterwise inference. The analyzed articles mostly used software Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI), or FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to conduct statistical analysis. There were 70.9\%, 37.6\%, and 23.1\% of SPM, AFNI, and FSL studies, respectively, that used a CDT of p ≤ 0.001. The statistical sample size across the articles ranged between 7 and 1,299 with a median of 33. Sample size did not signiﬁcantly correlate with the level of statistical threshold.
Conclusion: There were still around 53\% (142/270) studies using clusterwise inference that chose a more liberal CDT than p = 0.001 (n = 121) or did not report their CDT (n = 21), down from around 61\% reported by Woo et al. (2014). For FSL studies, it seemed that the CDT practice had no improvement since the survey by Woo et al. (2014). A few studies chose unconventional CDT such as p = 0.0125 or 0.004.},

While working memory engages dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), few studies have investigated whether these subfunctions are localized to different cortical depths in this region, and none have done so in humans. Here, we use high-resolution functional MRI to interrogate the layer specificity of neural activity during different epochs of a working memory task in dlPFC. We detect activity timecourses that follow the hypothesized patterns: superficial layers are preferentially active during the delay period, while deeper layers are preferentially active during the response. Results demonstrate that layer-specific fMRI can be used in higher-order brain regions to non-invasively map cognitive information processing along cortical circuitry in humans.},

	abstract = {The work of Neyman on confidence limits and of Fisher on fiducial limits is well known. However, in most applications the interval or limits fo only a single parameter or a single function of the parameters has been considered. Recently Scheff6 [2] and Tukey [3] have considered special cases of what may be called problems of simultaneous estimation, in which one is interested in giving confidence intervals for a finiite or infinite set of parametric functions such that the probability of the parametric functions of the set being simultaneously covered by the corresponding intervals is a preassigned number 1 - a(O {\textless} a {\textless} 1). In this paper we discuss in Section 1, a set of sufficient conditions under which such simultaneous estimation is possible, and bring out the connection of this with a method of test construction considered by one of the authors in a previous paper [1]. In Section 2 some univariate examples (including the ones due to Scheffe and Tukey) are considered from this point of view. Sections 3 to 6 are concerned with multivariate applications, giving results which are believed to be new. The associated tests all turn out to be the same as in [1] except for the example in Section 4.3 which, in a sense, is a multivariate generalization of Tukey's example (Section 2.2). Section 3 gives the notation and preliminaries for multivariate applications. Section 4 gives confidence bounds on linear functions of means for multivariate normal populations. Sections 5 and 6 give respectively confidence bounds on certain functions of the elements of population covariance matrices and population canonical regressions, from which a chain of simpler consequences would follow by the application of a set of matrix theorems. This has been partly indicated in the present paper and will be more fully discussed in a later paper.},

	abstract = {Animals execute goal-directed behaviours despite the limited range and scope of their sensors. To cope, they explore environments and store memories maintaining estimates of important information that is not presently available. Recently, progress has been made with artificial intelligence (AI) agents that learn to perform tasks from sensory input, even at a human level, by merging reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with deep neural networks, and the excitement surrounding these results has led to the pursuit of related ideas as explanations of non-human animal learning. However, we demonstrate that contemporary RL algorithms struggle to solve simple tasks when enough information is concealed from the sensors of the agent, a property called "partial observability". An obvious requirement for handling partially observed tasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is critical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a model, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory formation is guided by a process of predictive modeling. MERLIN facilitates the solution of tasks in 3D virtual reality environments for which partial observability is severe and memories must be maintained over long durations. Our model demonstrates a single learning agent architecture that can solve canonical behavioural tasks in psychology and neurobiology without strong simplifying assumptions about the dimensionality of sensory input or the duration of experiences.},

We investigated this in a novel decision-making task in humans (n = 76) while measuring brain activity with fMRI (n = 24). Modeling revealed that participants computed the prospective value of decisions: they planned their future behavior taking into account how their decisions might affect which states they would encounter and how they themselves might respond in these states. They considered their own likely future behavioral biases (e.g., failure to adapt to changes in prospective value) and avoided situations in which they might be prone to such biases. Three neural networks in adjacent medial frontal regions were linked to distinct components of prospective decision making: activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, area 8 m/9, and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex reﬂected prospective value, anticipated changes in prospective value, and the degree to which prospective value inﬂuenced decisions.},

	abstract = {High-resolution blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at the submillimeter scale has become feasible with recent advances in MR technology. In principle, this would enable the study of layered cortical circuits, one of the fundaments of cortical computation. However, the spatial layout of cortical blood supply may become an important confound at such high resolution. In particular, venous blood draining back to the cortical surface perpendicularly to the layered structure is expected to inﬂuence the measured responses in different layers. Here, we present an extension of a hemodynamic model commonly used for analyzing fMRI data (in dynamic causal models or biophysical network models) that accounts for such blood draining effects by coupling local hemodynamics across layers. We illustrate the properties of the model and its inversion by a series of simulations and show that it successfully captures layered fMRI data obtained during a simple visual experiment. We conclude that for future studies of the dynamics of layered neuronal circuits with high-resolution fMRI, it will be pivotal to include effects of blood draining, particularly when trying to infer on the layer-speciﬁc connections in cortex — a theme of key relevance for brain disorders like schizophrenia and for theories of brain function such as predictive coding.},

To what extent are the findings from any single study reproducible? Are researchers who lack the resources to conduct a fMRI study being needlessly excluded? Is pre-existing fMRI data being used effectively to train new students in the field? Here, we will argue that greater sharing and synthesis of raw fMRI data among researchers would make the answers to all of these questions more favorable to scientific discovery than they are today and that such sharing is an important next step for advancing the field of cognitive neuroscience.},

Methods—Focus group sessions with (1) current research participants, (2) surrogate decisionmakers, and (3) three age-defined cohorts (18–34 years, 35–50, {\textgreater}50).
Results—Participants expressed a variety of opinions about the acceptability of wide sharing of genetic and phenotypic information for research purposes through large, publicly accessible data repositories. Most believed that making de-identified study data available to the research community is a social good that should be pursued. Privacy and confidentiality concerns were common, though they would not necessarily preclude participation. Many participants voiced reservations about sharing data with for-profit organizations.
Conclusions—Trust is central in participants’ views regarding GWAS data sharing. Further research is needed to develop governance models that enact the values of stewardship.},

Here we propose an ultra-fast method to map the distribution of the functional connectivity density (FCD) in the human brain. The method was tested in 972 subjects from a large repository of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) time series collected in resting conditions. Consistently across research sites, a region located in the ventral precuneus was the area with the highest FCD, which suggest that this is a prominent functional hub in the brain. In addition regions located in the paracentral lobule, cuneus, inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate cortices had localized high FCD, suggesting that these regions also include prominent functional connectivity hubs.},

Seeking consent to data sharing is a challenge for dementia research where patients have lost or risk losing legal capacity. The laws of most countries enable substitute decision makers (SDMs) to consent on behalf of incapable adults to research participation. We compare regulatory frameworks governing capacity, research, and personal data protection across eight countries to determine when SDMs can consent to data sharing. In most countries, an SDM can consent to data sharing in the incapable adult’s best interests. Best interests typically include consideration of the individual’s previously expressed wishes, values and beliefs; well-being; and inclusion in decision making. Countries differ in how these considerations are balanced. A clear previous consent or refusal to share data typically binds the discretion of an SDM. Though generally permissive, National patchworks of laws and guidelines cause confusion. Clarity on the applicable law and processes to enhance ethical decision making are needed to facilitate substitute consent. Researchers can encourage patients to communicate their research preferences before a loss of capacity, and educate SDMs about their ethical and legal duties. The research community must also continue to promote the importance of data sharing in dementia.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of data sharing into the research lifecycle is an important part of modern scholarly debate. In this study, the DataONE Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals: To examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and practices among research scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010 baseline study, and to examine differences in practices and perceptions across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines. We distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October 2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3–4 years. We also looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor, educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such complex grand science challenges.},

	abstract = {Background: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results.
Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the shortand long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region.
Conclusions/Significance: Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Objective: Our objective is to explain the changes in data protection laws that apply to medical research and to discuss their potential impact.
Methods: Analysis of ethicolegal requirements imposed by the GDPR.
Results: The GDPR makes the classification of pseudonymised data as personal data clearer, although it has not been entirely resolved. Biomedical research on personal data where consent has not been obtained must be of substantial public interest.
Conclusions: The GDPR introduces protections for data subjects that aim for consistency across the EU. The proposed changes will make little impact on biomedical data research.},

	abstract = {The EU offers a suitable milieu for the comparison and harmonisation of healthcare across different languages, cultures, and jurisdictions (albeit with a supranational legal framework), which could provide improvements in healthcare standards across the bloc. There are specific ethico-legal issues with the use of data in healthcare research that mandate a different approach from other forms of research. The use of healthcare data over a long period of time is similar to the use of tissue in biobanks. There is a low risk to subjects but it is impossible to gain specific informed consent given the future possibilities for research. Large amounts of data on a subject present a finite risk of re-identification. Consequently, there is a balancing act between this risk and retaining sufficient utility of the data. Anonymising methods need to take into account the circumstances of data sharing to enable an appropriate balance in all cases. There are ethical and policy advantages to exceeding the legal requirements and thereby securing the social licence for research. This process would require the examination and comparison of data protection laws across the trading bloc to produce an ethico-legal framework compatible with the requirements of all member states. Seven EU jurisdictions are given consideration in this critique.},

	abstract = {Background: Obtaining informed consent is a cornerstone of biomedical research, yet participants comprehension of presented information is often low. The most effective interventions to improve understanding rates have not been identified.
Purpose: To systematically analyze the random controlled trials testing interventions to research informed consent process. The primary outcome of interest was quantitative rates of participant understanding; secondary outcomes were rates of information retention, satisfaction, and accrual. Interventional categories included multimedia, enhanced consent documents, extended discussions, test/feedback quizzes, and miscellaneous methods.
Methods: The search spanned from database inception through September 2010. It was run on Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid CINAHL, Ovid PsycInfo and Cochrane CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science and Scopus. Five reviewers working independently and in duplicate screened full abstract text to determine eligibility. We included only RCTs. 39 out of 1523 articles fulfilled review criteria (2.6\%), with a total of 54 interventions. A data extraction form was created in Distiller, an online reference management system, through an iterative process. One author collected data on study design, population, demographics, intervention, and analytical technique.
Results: Meta-analysis was possible on 22 interventions: multimedia, enhanced form, and extended discussion categories; all 54 interventions were assessed by review. Meta-analysis of multimedia approaches was associated with a non-significant increase in understanding scores (SMD 0.30, 95\% CI, -0.23 to 0.84); enhanced consent form, with significant increase (SMD 1.73, 95\% CI, 0.99 to 2.47); and extended discussion, with significant increase (SMD 0.53, 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.84). By review, 31\% of multimedia interventions showed significant improvement in understanding; 41\% for enhanced consent form; 50\% for extended discussion; 33\% for test/feedback; and 29\% for miscellaneous. Multiple sources of variation existed between included studies: control processes, the presence of a human proctor, real vs. simulated protocol, and assessment formats.
Conclusions: Enhanced consent forms and extended discussions were most effective in improving participant understanding. Interventions of all categories had no negative impact on participant satisfaction or study accrual. Identification of best practices for studies of informed consent interventions would aid future systematic comparisons.},

It suggests the potential in integrating research that crosses the statistical, computational, and human boundaries. Furthermore, it puts into focus that, to solve real world problems, a data scientist will need to undertake tasks that are beyond their traditional training. Data science is more than the combination of statistics and computer science—it requires training in how to weave statistical and computational techniques into a larger framework, problem by problem, and to address discipline-specific questions. Holistic data science requires that we understand the context of data, appreciate the responsibilities involved in using private and public data, and clearly communicate what a dataset can and cannot tell us about the world.},

Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent an approximate posterior distribution and uses this for optimisation of a variational lower bound. We develop stochastic backpropagation – rules for gradient backpropagation through stochastic variables – and derive an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition models. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that by using stochastic backpropagation and variational inference, we obtain models that are able to generate realistic samples of data, allow for accurate imputations of missing data, and provide a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reﬂected in experimental results.},

The KL divergence between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is frequently needed in the ﬁelds of speech and image recognition. Unfortunately the KL divergence between two GMMs is not analytically tractable, nor does any efﬁcient computational algorithm exist. Some techniques cope with this problem by replacing the KL divergence with other functions that can be computed efﬁciently. We introduce two new methods, the variational approximation and the variational upper bound, and compare them to existing methods. We discuss seven different techniques in total and weigh the beneﬁts of each one against the others. To conclude we evaluate the performance of each one through numerical experiments.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

But as the pre-history of the area can be considered to last to the first quarter of our century, we can say that Statistical Extremes emer ged in the last half-century. It began with the paper by Dodd in 1923, followed quickly by the papers of Fre-chet in 1927 and Fisher and Tippett in 1928, after by the papers by de Finetti in 1932, by Gumbel in 1935 and by von Mises in 1936, to cite the more relevant; the first complete frame in what regards probabilistic problems is due to Gnedenko in 1943. And by that time Extremes begin to explode not only in what regards applications (floods, breaking strength of materials, gusts of wind, etc.) but also in areas going from Proba bility to Stochastic Processes, from Multivariate Structures to Statistical Decision. The history, after the first essential steps, can't be written in few pages: the narrow and shallow stream gained momentum and is now a huge river, enlarging at every moment and flooding the margins. Statistical Extremes is, thus, a clear-cut field of Probability and Statistics and a new exploding area for research.},

We propose lower and upper bounds for the KL divergence, which lead to a new approximation and interesting insights into previously proposed approximations. An application to the comparison of speaker models also shows how such approximations can be used to validate assumptions on the models.},

First, the empirical estimate is simpler than any other kernel dependence test, and requires no user-deﬁned regularisation. Second, there is a clearly deﬁned population quantity which the empirical estimate approaches in the large sample limit, with exponential convergence guaranteed between the two: this ensures that independence tests based on HSIC do not suﬀer from slow learning rates. Finally, we show in the context of independent component analysis (ICA) that the performance of HSIC is competitive with that of previously published kernel-based criteria, and of other recently published ICA methods.},

	title = {Hamiltonian {Variational} {Auto}-{Encoder}},
	abstract = {Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have become very popular techniques to perform inference and learning in latent variable models: they allow us to leverage the rich representational power of neural networks to obtain ﬂexible approximations of the posterior of latent variables as well as tight evidence lower bounds (ELBOs). Combined with stochastic variational inference, this provides a methodology scaling to large datasets. However, for this methodology to be practically efﬁcient, it is necessary to obtain low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients with respect to the parameters of interest. While the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been previously suggested to achieve this [25, 28], the proposed methods require specifying reverse kernels which have a large impact on performance. Additionally, the resulting unbiased estimator of the ELBO for most MCMC kernels is typically not amenable to the reparameterization trick. We show here how to optimally select reverse kernels in this setting and, by building upon Hamiltonian Importance Sampling (HIS) [19], we obtain a scheme that provides low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients using the reparameterization trick. This allows us to develop a Hamiltonian Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE). This method can be re-interpreted as a target-informed normalizing ﬂow [22] which, within our context, only requires a few evaluations of the gradient of the sampled likelihood and trivial Jacobian calculations at each iteration.},

While providing appealing ﬂexibility, this approach makes it difﬁcult to impose or assess structural constraints such as conditional independence. We propose a framework for learning representations that relies on auto-encoding variational Bayes, in which the search space is constrained via kernel-based measures of independence. In particular, our method employs the d-variable Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (dHSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations and arbitrary nuisance factors. We show how this method can be applied to a range of problems, including problems that involve learning invariant and conditionally independent representations. We also present a full-ﬂedged application to singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In this setting the biological signal is mixed in complex ways with sequencing errors and sampling effects. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in this domain.},

	abstract = {Balancing exploration and exploitation is a fundamental aspect of decision-making. It remains unknown whether people are close to optimal in striking this balance, and if not, how exactly their behavior deviates from optimality. Many existing paradigms are not ideally suited to answer this question, as they contain complexities such as non-stationary environments, stochasticity under exploitation, and reward distributions that are unknown to participants. Here, we introduce a task without such complexities, in which the optimal policy is to start off exploring and to switch to exploitation at most once in each sequence of decisions. The behavior of 49 laboratory and 143 online participants deviated both qualitatively and quantitatively from the optimal policy, even when allowing for bias and decision noise. Instead, people seem to follow a suboptimal rule in which they switch from exploration to exploitation when the highest reward so far exceeds a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that this threshold decreases approximately linearly with the proportion of the sequence that remains, suggesting a novel temporal ratio law. Finally, we find evidence for "sequence-level" variability which is shared across all decisions in the same sequence. Our results provide a new perspective on the explore-exploit dilemma, and emphasize the importance of examining sequence-level strategies and their variability when studying sequential decision-making.},

	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the biomedical literature suffers from a surfeit of false positive results. Part of the reason for this is the persistence of the myth that observation of p {\textless} 0.05 is sufficient justification to claim that you have made a discovery. It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05.},

The point of view expressed here is that observables are fundamental, and that the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information. Further, the prediction of future observables provides multiple advantages to practicing scientists, and to science in general. These include an interpretable numerical summary of a quantity of direct interest to current and future researchers, a calibrated prediction of what’s likely to happen in future experiments, a prediction that can be either “corroborated” or “refuted” through experimentation, and avoidance of inference about parameters; quantities that exists only as convenient indices of hypothetical distributions. Finally, the predictive probability of a future observable can be used as a standard for communicating the reliability of the current work, regardless of whether confirmatory experiments are conducted. Adoption of this paradigm would improve our rigor for scientific accuracy and reproducibility by shifting our focus from “finding differences” among hypothetical parameters to predicting observable events based on our current scientific understanding.},

Such courses can speed up the process of gaining statistical wisdom by giving students insight into the human propensity to make statistical errors, the meaning of a single test within a research project, ways in which p-values work and don’t work as expected, the role of statistics in the lifecycle of science, and best practices for statistical communication. The course we have developed follows the story of how we use data to understand the world, leveraging simulation-based approaches to perform customized analyses and evaluate the behavior of statistical procedures. We provide ideas for expanding beyond the traditional classroom, two example activities, and a course syllabus as well as the set of statistical best practices for creating and consuming scientific information that we develop during the course.},

The resulting hypothesis tests do not violate the Likelihood Principle and do not require any constraints on the dimensionalities of the sample space and parameter space. The procedure includes an ordering of the entire sample space and uses predictive probability (density) functions, allowing for testing of both simple and compound hypotheses. Accessible examples are presented to highlight specific characteristics of the new tests.},

	abstract = {A statistically significant research finding should not be defined as a P -value of 0.05 or less, because this definition does not take into account study power. Statistical significance was originally defined by Fisher RA as a P -value of 0.05 or less. According to Fisher, any finding that is likely to occur by random variation no more than 1 in 20 times is considered significant. Neyman J and Pearson ES subsequently argued that Fisher’s definition was incomplete. They proposed that statistical significance could only be determined by analyzing the chance of incorrectly considering a study finding was significant (a Type Ⅰ error) or incorrectly considering a study finding was insignificant (a Type Ⅱ error). Their definition of statistical significance is also incomplete because the error rates are considered separately, not together. A better definition of statistical significance is the positive predictive value of a P -value, which is equal to the power divided by the sum of power and the P -value. This definition is more complete and relevant than Fisher’s or Neyman-Peason’s definitions, because it takes into account both concepts of statistical significance. Using this definition, a statistically significant finding requires a P -value of 0.05 or less when the power is at least 95\%, and a P -value of 0.032 or less when the power is 60\%. To achieve statistical significance, P -values must be adjusted downward as the study power decreases.},

By contrast, it has been considerably more difﬁcult to relate these components to neurobiologically grounded accounts of language. Here, we propose a theoretical framework based on a predictive coding architecture, within which negative language-related ERP components such as the N400 can be accounted for in a neurobiologically plausible manner. Speciﬁcally, we posit that the amplitude of negative language-related ERP components reﬂects precision-weighted prediction error signals, i.e., prediction errors weighted by the relevance of the information source leading to the error. From this perspective, precision has a direct link to cue validity in a particular language and, thereby, to relevance of individual linguistic features for internal model updating. We view components such as the N400 and LAN as members of a family with similar functional characteristics and suggest that latency and topography differences between these components reﬂect the locus of prediction errors and model updating within a hierarchically organized cortical predictive coding architecture. This account has the potential to unify ﬁndings from the full range of the N400 literature, including word-level, sentence-, and discourse-level results as well as cross-linguistic differences.},

	abstract = {When semantic information is activated by a context prior to new bottom-up input (i.e. when a word is predicted), semantic processing of that incoming word is typically facilitated, attenuating the amplitude of the N400 event related potential (ERP) – a direct neural measure of semantic processing. N400 modulation is observed even when the context is a single semantically related “prime” word. This so-called “N400 semantic priming effect” is sensitive to the probability of encountering a related prime-target pair within an experimental block, suggesting that participants may be adapting the strength of their predictions to the predictive validity of their broader experimental environment. We formalize this adaptation using a Bayesian learning model that estimates and updates the probability of encountering a related versus an unrelated prime-target pair on each successive trial. We found that our model’s trial-by-trial estimates of target word probability accounted for significant variance in trial-by-trial N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that Bayesian principles contribute to how comprehenders adapt their semantic predictions to the statistical structure of their broader environment, with implications for the functional significance of the N400 component and the predictive nature of language processing.},

	abstract = {This tutorial provides a worked example of using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) to characterise inter-subject variability in neural circuitry (effective connectivity). This involves specifying a hierarchical model with two or more levels. At the first level, state space models (DCMs) are used to infer the effective connectivity that best explains a subject’s neuroimaging timeseries (e.g. fMRI, MEG, EEG). Subject-specific connectivity parameters are then taken to the group level, where they are modelled using a General Linear Model (GLM) that partitions between-subject variability into designed effects and additive random effects. The ensuing (Bayesian) hierarchical model conveys both the estimated connection strengths and their uncertainty (i.e., posterior covariance) from the subject to the group level; enabling hypotheses to be tested about the commonalities and differences across subjects. This approach can also finesse parameter estimation at the subject level, by using the group-level parameters as empirical priors. We walk through this approach in detail, using data from a published fMRI experiment that characterised individual differences in hemispheric lateralization in a semantic processing task. The preliminary subject specific DCM analysis is covered in detail in a companion paper. This tutorial is accompanied by the example dataset and step-by-step instructions to reproduce the analyses.},

	abstract = {Multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis is often concerned with determining whether there exists a signiﬁcant population-wide ’activation’ in a comparison between two or more conditions. Typically this is assessed by testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates (COPE) against zero in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. In this work we investigate several aspects of this type of analysis. First, we study the e↵ects of sample size on the sensitivity and reliability of the group analysis, allowing us to evaluate the ability of small sampled studies to e↵ectively capture population-level e↵ects of interest. Second, we assess the di↵erence in sensitivity and reliability when using volumetric or surface based data. Third, we investigate potential biases in estimating e↵ect sizes as a function of sample size. To perform this analysis we utilize the task-based fMRI data from the 500-subject release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We treat the complete collection of subjects (N = 491) as our population of interest, and perform a single-subject analysis on each subject in the population. We investigate the ability to recover population level e↵ects using a subset of the population and standard analytical techniques. Our study shows that sample sizes of 40 are generally able to detect regions with high e↵ect sizes (Cohen’s d {\textgreater} 0.8), while sample sizes closer to 80 are required to reliably recover regions with medium e↵ect sizes (0.5 {\textless} d {\textless} 0.8). We ﬁnd little di↵erence in results when using volumetric or surface based data with respect to standard mass-univariate group analysis. Finally, we conclude that special care is needed when estimating e↵ect sizes, particularly for small sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are well-known techniques for feature extraction from two sets of multidimensional variables. The fundamental difference between CCA and PLS is that CCA maximizes the correlation while PLS maximizes the covariance. Although both CCA and PLS have been applied successfully in various applications, the intrinsic relationship between them remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by showing the equivalence relationship between CCA and orthonormalized partial least squares (OPLS), a variant of PLS. We further extend the equivalence relationship to the case when regularization is employed for both sets of variables. In addition, we show that the CCA projection for one set of variables is independent of the regularization on the other set of variables. We have performed experimental studies using both synthetic and real data sets and our results conﬁrm the established equivalence relationship. The presented analysis provides novel insights into the connection between these two existing algorithms as well as the effect of the regularization.},

VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits [1, 2], faces [1, 3, 4], house numbers [5, 6], CIFAR images [6], physical models of scenes [4], segmentation [7], and predicting the future from static images [8]. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the dynamic causal modelling of fMRI timeseries by replacing the usual (Taylor) approximation to neuronal dynamics with a neural mass model of the canonical microcircuit. This provides a generative or dynamic causal model of laminar speciﬁc responses that can generate haemodynamic and electrophysiological measurements. In principle, this allows the fusion of haemodynamic and (event related or induced) electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, it enables Bayesian model comparison of competing hypotheses about physiologically plausible synaptic eﬀects; for example, does attentional modulation act on superﬁcial or deep pyramidal cells – or both? In this technical note, we describe the resulting dynamic causal model and provide an illustrative application to the attention to visual motion dataset used in previous papers. Our focus here is on how to answer long-standing questions in fMRI; for example, do haemodynamic responses reﬂect extrinsic (aﬀerent) input from distant cortical regions, or do they reﬂect intrinsic (recurrent) neuronal activity? To what extent do inhibitory interneurons contribute to neurovascular coupling? What is the relationship between haemodynamic responses and the frequency of induced neuronal activity? This paper does not pretend to answer these questions; rather it shows how they can be addressed using neural mass models of fMRI timeseries.},

	abstract = {In this technical note, we address an unresolved challenge in neuroimaging statistics: how to determine which of several datasets is the best for inferring neuronal responses. Comparisons of this kind are important for experimenters when choosing an imaging protocol—and for developers of new acquisition methods. However, the hypothesis that one dataset is better than another cannot be tested using conventional statistics (based on likelihood ratios), as these require the data to be the same under each hypothesis. Here we present Bayesian data comparison (BDC), a principled framework for evaluating the quality of functional imaging data, in terms of the precision with which neuronal connectivity parameters can be estimated and competing models can be disambiguated. For each of several candidate datasets, neuronal responses are modeled using Bayesian (probabilistic) forward models, such as General Linear Models (GLMs) or Dynamic Casual Models (DCMs). Next, the parameters from subject-speciﬁc models are summarized at the group level using a Bayesian GLM. A series of measures, which we introduce here, are then used to evaluate each dataset in terms of the precision of (group-level) parameter estimates and the ability of the data to distinguish similar models. To exemplify the approach, we compared four datasets that were acquired in a study evaluating multiband fMRI acquisition schemes, and we used simulations to establish the face validity of the comparison measures. To enable people to reproduce these analyses using their own data and experimental paradigms, we provide general-purpose Matlab code via the SPM software.},

	abstract = {Analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience have not always matched the richness of fMRI data. Early methods focused on estimating neural activity within individual voxels or regions, averaged over trials or blocks and modeled separately in each participant. This approach mostly neglected the distributed nature of neural representations over voxels, the continuous dynamics of neural activity during tasks, the statistical benefits of performing joint inference over multiple participants and the value of using predictive models to constrain analysis. Several recent exploratory and theory-driven methods have begun to pursue these opportunities. These methods highlight the importance of computational techniques in fMRI analysis, especially machine learning, algorithmic optimization and parallel computing. Adoption of these techniques is enabling a new generation of experiments and analyses that could transform our understanding of some of the most complex—and distinctly human—signals in the brain: acts of cognition such as thoughts, intentions and memories.},

	abstract = {Background: Innovations in technology have contributed to rapid changes in the way that modern biomedical research is carried out. Researchers are increasingly required to endorse adaptive and flexible approaches to accommodate these innovations and comply with ethical, legal and regulatory requirements. This paper explores how Dynamic Consent may provide solutions to address challenges encountered when researchers invite individuals to participate in research and follow them up over time in a continuously changing environment.
Methods: An interdisciplinary workshop jointly organised by the University of Oxford and the COST Action CHIP ME gathered clinicians, researchers, ethicists, lawyers, research participants and patient representatives to discuss experiences of using Dynamic Consent, and how such use may facilitate the conduct of specific research tasks. The data collected during the workshop were analysed using a content analysis approach.
Results: Dynamic Consent can provide practical, sustainable and future-proof solutions to challenges related to participant recruitment, the attainment of informed consent, participant retention and consent management, and may bring economic efficiencies.
Conclusions: Dynamic Consent offers opportunities for ongoing communication between researchers and research participants that can positively impact research. Dynamic Consent supports inter-sector, cross-border approaches and large scale data-sharing. Whilst it is relatively easy to set up and maintain, its implementation will require that researchers re-consider their relationship with research participants and adopt new procedures.},

However, this inference is both ill-posed (Helmholtz, 1856; Marr, 1982) and corrupted by noise (Green \& Swets, 1989), requiring the brain to compute perceptual beliefs under conditions of uncertainty. Here we show that human observers performing a simple visual choice task under an externally imposed loss function approach the optimal strategy, as deﬁned by Bayesian probability and decision theory (Berger, 1985; Cox, 1961). In concert with earlier work, this suggests that observers possess a model of their internal uncertainty and can utilize this model in the neural computations that underlie their behavior (Knill \& Pouget, 2004). In our experiment, optimal behavior requires that observers integrate the loss function with an estimate of their internal uncertainty rather than simply requiring that they use a modal estimate of the uncertain stimulus. Crucially, they approach optimal behavior even when denied the opportunity to learn adaptive decision strategies based on immediate feedback. Our data thus support the idea that ﬂexible representations of uncertainty are pre-existing, widespread, and can be propagated to decision-making areas of the brain.},

We start our review of the theory on nonlinear filtering from the simplest ‘filtering’ task we can think of, namely static Bayesian inference. From there we continue our journey through discrete-time models, which are usually encountered in machine learning, and generalize to continuous-time filtering theory. The idea of changing the probability measure connects and elucidates several aspects of the theory, such as the parallels between the discrete- and continuous-time problems and between different observation models. Furthermore, it provides insight into the construction of particle filtering algorithms. This tutorial is targeted at scientists and engineers and should serve as an introduction to the main ideas of nonlinear filtering, and as a segway to more advanced and specialized literature.},

We make use of the Variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates the true posterior density with a factorised density. The ﬁdelity of this approximation is veriﬁed via Gibbs sampling. The VB approach provides a natural extension to previous Bayesian analyses which have used Empirical Bayes. VB has the advantage of taking into account the variability of hyperparameter estimates with little additional computational effort. Further, VB allows for automatic selection of the order of the AR process. Results are shown on simulated data and on data from an event-related fMRI experiment.},

We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain – variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference –what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control – the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies – and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in both the representation of "state," in studies of reinforcement learning and decision making, and also in the representation of "schemas," in studies of episodic memory. Both of these cognitive constructs require a similar inference about the underlying situation or "latent cause" that generates our observations at any given time. The statistically optimal solution to this inference problem is to use Bayes' rule to compute a posterior probability distribution over latent causes. To test whether such a posterior probability distribution is represented in the OFC, we tasked human participants with inferring a probability distribution over four possible latent causes, based on their observations. Using fMRI pattern similarity analyses, we found that BOLD activity in the OFC is best explained as representing the (log-transformed) posterior distribution over latent causes. Furthermore, this pattern explained OFC activity better than other task-relevant alternatives, such as the most probable latent cause, the most recent observation, or the uncertainty over latent causes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our world is governed by hidden (latent) causes that we cannot observe, but which generate the observations we see. A range of high-level cognitive processes require inference of a probability distribution (or "belief distribution") over the possible latent causes that might be generating our current observations. This is true for reinforcement learning and decision making (where the latent cause comprises the true "state" of the task), and for episodic memory (where memories are believed to be organized by the inferred situation or "schema"). Using fMRI, we show that this belief distribution over latent causes is encoded in patterns of brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, an area that has been separately implicated in the representations of both states and schemas.},

	abstract = {Learning to predict future outcomes is critical for driving appropriate behaviors. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have successfully accounted for such learning, relying on reward prediction errors (RPEs) signaled by midbrain dopamine neurons. It has been proposed that when sensory data provide only ambiguous information about which state an animal is in, it can predict reward based on a set of probabilities assigned to hypothetical states (called the belief state). Here we examine how dopamine RPEs and subsequent learning are regulated under state uncertainty. Mice are first trained in a task with two potential states defined by different reward amounts. During testing, intermediate-sized rewards are given in rare trials. Dopamine activity is a non-monotonic function of reward size, consistent with RL models operating on belief states. Furthermore, the magnitude of dopamine responses quantitatively predicts changes in behavior. These results establish the critical role of state inference in RL.},

Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.},

We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

	abstract = {We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes- optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.},

Model-based algorithms achieve flexibility at computational expense, by rebuilding values from a model of the environment. We examine an intermediate class of algorithms, the successor representation (SR), which caches long-run state expectancies, blending model-free efficiency with model-based flexibility. Although previous reward revaluation studies distinguish model-free from model-based learning algorithms, such designs cannot discriminate between model-based and SR-based algorithms, both of which predict sensitivity to reward revaluation. However, changing the transition structure (" transition revaluation ") should selectively impair revaluation for the SR. In two studies we provide evidence that humans are differentially sensitive to reward vs. transition revaluation, consistent with SR predictions. These results support a new neuro-computational mechanism for flexible choice, while introducing a subtler, more cognitive notion of habit.},

There is also longstanding line of thought that links dopamine with belief formation and, crucially, aberrant belief formation in psychosis. Integrating these strands of evidence would suggest that dopamine plays a central role in belief updating and more specifically in encoding of meaningful information content in observations. The precise nature of this relationship has remained unclear. To directly address this question we developed a paradigm that allowed us to decompose two distinct types of information content, information-theoretic surprise that reflects the unexpectedness of an observation, and epistemic value that induces shifts in beliefs or, more formally, Bayesian surprise. Using functional magnetic-resonance imaging in humans we show that dopamine-rich midbrain regions encode shifts in beliefs whereas surprise is encoded in prefrontal regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area and dorsal cingulate cortex. By linking putative dopaminergic activity to belief updating these data provide a link to false belief formation that characterises hyperdopaminergic states associated with idiopathic and drug induced psychosis.},

It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems-like ourselves-try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed "exploitation") and visiting a number of different goal-states ("exploration"). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.},

To test this idea, we apply pattern-classification techniques to neuroimaging data from humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show that unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC, and decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the occurrence of individual behavioral errors. Moreover, similarity between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates with behavioral accuracy in corresponding state transitions. These results support the idea that OFC represents a cognitive map of task space and establish the feasibility of decoding state representations in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging.},

Recently, we proposed a generic model based on active (Bayesian) inference wherein dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about optimal policies. Put simply, dopamine discharges reflect the confidence that a chosen policy will lead to desired outcomes. We designed a novel task to test this hypothesis, where subjects played a "limited offer" game in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Subjects had to decide how long to wait for a high offer before accepting a low offer, with the risk of losing everything if they waited too long. Bayesian model comparison showed that behavior strongly supported active inference, based on surprise minimization, over classical utility maximization schemes. Furthermore, midbrain activity, encompassing dopamine projection neurons, was accurately predicted by trial-by-trial variations in model-based estimates of precision. Our findings demonstrate that human subjects infer both optimal policies and the precision of those inferences, and thus support the notion that humans perform hierarchical probabilistic Bayesian inference. In other words, subjects have to infer both what they should do as well as how confident they are in their choices, where confidence may be encoded by dopaminergic firing.},

To distinguish these approaches in humans, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in a continuous spatial navigation task, in which frequent changes to the layout of the maze forced subjects continually to relearn their favored routes, thereby exposing the RL mechanisms used. We sought evidence for the neural substrates of such mechanisms by comparing choice behavior and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals to decision variables extracted from simulations of either algorithm. Both choices and value-related BOLD signals in striatum, although most often associated with TD learning, were better explained by the model-based theory. Furthermore, predecessor quantities for the model-based value computation were correlated with BOLD signals in the medial temporal lobe and frontal cortex. These results point to a significant extension of both the computational and anatomical substrates for RL in the brain.},

Here, we show that these two strategies rely on different neural systems. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to selectively inhibit right frontopolar cortex, we were able to selectively inhibit directed exploration while leaving random exploration intact, suggesting a causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration.},

	abstract = {Investigations of the underlying mechanisms of choice in humans have focused on learning from prediction errors, leaving the computational structure of value based planning comparatively underexplored. Using behavioral and neuroimaging analyses of a minimax decision task, we found that the computational processes underlying forward planning are expressed in the anterior caudate nucleus as values of individual branching steps in a decision tree. In contrast, values represented in the putamen pertain solely to values learned during extensive training. During actual choice, both striatal areas showed a functional coupling to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, consistent with this region acting as a value comparator. Our findings point toward an architecture of choice in which segregated value systems operate in parallel in the striatum for planning and extensively trained choices, with medial prefrontal cortex integrating their outputs.},

	abstract = {Making optimal decisions in the face of uncertain or incomplete information arises as a common problem in everyday behavior, but the neural processes underlying this ability remain poorly understood. A typical case is navigation, in which a subject has to search for a known goal from an unknown location. Navigating under uncertain conditions requires making decisions on the basis of the current belief about location and updating that belief based on incoming information. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging during a maze navigation task to study neural activity relating to the resolution of uncertainty as subjects make sequential decisions to reach a goal. We show that distinct regions of prefrontal cortex are engaged in specific computational functions that are well described by a Bayesian model of decision making. This permits efficient goal-oriented navigation and provides new insights into decision making by humans. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It considers RSA and PCM as Bayesian model comparison procedures that assess the evidence for stimulus or condition-specific patterns of responses distributed over voxels or channels. On this view, one can use standard variational inference procedures to quantify the contributions of particular patterns to the data, by evaluating second-order parameters or hyperparameters. Crucially, this allows one to use parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) to infer which patterns are consistent among subjects. At the between-subject level, one can then assess the evidence for different (combinations of) hypotheses about condition-specific effects using Bayesian model comparison. Alternatively, one can select a single hypothesis that best explains the pattern of responses using Bayesian model selection. This note rehearses the technical aspects of within and between-subject RSA using a worked example, as implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. En route, we highlight the connection between univariate and multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and the sorts of analyses that are possible using component modelling and representational similarity analysis.},

In the appendices, we detail the theory underlying DCM and the assumptions (i.e., priors) in the models. In the first part of the guide (current paper), we focus on issues specific to DCM for fMRI. This is accompanied by all the necessary data and instructions to reproduce the analyses using the SPM software.

These models are usually intractable and thus require approximate inference. Variational inference (VI) lets us approximate a high-dimensional Bayesian posterior with a simpler variational distribution by solving an optimization problem. This approach has been successfully applied to various models and large-scale applications. In this review, we give an overview of recent trends in variational inference. We ﬁrst introduce standard mean ﬁeld variational inference, then review recent advances focusing on the following aspects: (a) scalable VI, which includes stochastic approximations, (b) generic VI, which extends the applicability of VI to a large class of otherwise intractable models, such as non-conjugate models, (c) accurate VI, which includes variational models beyond the mean ﬁeld approximation or with atypical divergences, and (d) amortized VI, which implements the inference over local latent variables with inference networks. Finally, we provide a summary of promising future research directions.},

Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer’s input-space to the same output. In this way, deep models compute functions that react equally to complicated patterns of different inputs. The compositional structure of these functions enables them to re-use pieces of computation exponentially often in terms of the network’s depth. This paper investigates the complexity of such compositional maps and contributes new theoretical results regarding the advantage of depth for neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In particular, our analysis is not speciﬁc to a single family of models, and as an example, we employ it for rectiﬁer and maxout networks. We improve complexity bounds from pre-existing work and investigate the behavior of units in higher layers.},

RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difﬁcult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We ﬁnd that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion direction processing.},

	abstract = {Most reward-related electroencephalogram (EEG) studies focus exclusively on the feedback-related negativity (FRN, also known as feedback negativity or FN, medial-frontal negativity or MFN, feedback error-related negativity or fERN, and reward positivity or RewP). This component is usually measured approximately 200–300 ms post-feedback at a single electrode in the frontal-central area (e.g., Fz or FCz). The present review argues that this singular focus on the FRN fails to leverage EEG's greatest strength, its temporal resolution, by underutilizing the rich variety of event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency components encompassing the wider temporal heterogeneity of reward processing. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of often overlooked ERP and EEG correlates beyond the FRN in the context of reward processing with the secondary goal of guiding future research toward multistage experimental designs and multicomponent analyses that leverage the temporal power of EEG. We comprehensively review reward-related ERPs (including the FRN, readiness potential or RP, stimulus-preceding negativity or SPN, contingent-negative variation or CNV, cue-related N2 and P3, Feedback-P3, and late-positive potential or LPP/ slow-wave), and reward-related EEG time-frequency components (changes in power at alpha, beta, theta, and delta bands). These electrophysiological signatures display distinct time-courses, scalp topographies, and reﬂect independent psychological processes during anticipatory and/or outcome stages of reward processing. Special consideration is given to the time-course of each component and factors that signiﬁcantly contribute to component variation. Concluding remarks identify current limitations along with recommendations for potential important future directions.},

	abstract = {A central objective of empirical research on treatment response is to inform treatment choice. Unfortunately, researchers commonly use concepts of statistical inference whose foundations are distant from the problem of treatment choice. It has been particularly common to use hypothesis tests to compare treatments. Wald’s development of statistical decision theory provides a coherent frequentist framework for use of sample data on treatment response to make treatment decisions. A body of recent research applies statistical decision theory to characterize uniformly satisfactory treatment choices, in the sense of maximum loss relative to optimal decisions (also known as maximum regret). This article describes the basic ideas and findings, which provide an appealing practical alternative to use of hypothesis tests. For simplicity, the article focuses on medical treatment with evidence from classical randomized clinical trials. The ideas apply generally, encompassing use of observational data and treatment choice in nonmedical contexts.},

In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10\% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (p = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},

From a machine learning point of view, it amounts to a matrix factorization problem with a statistical independence criterion. Infomax is one of the most used ICA algorithms. It is based on a loss function which is a non-convex loglikelihood. We develop a new majorizationminimization framework adapted to this loss function. We derive an online algorithm for the streaming setting, and an incremental algorithm for the ﬁnite sum setting, with the following beneﬁts. First, unlike most algorithms found in the literature, the proposed methods do not rely on any critical hyperparameter like a step size, nor do they require a line-search technique. Second, the algorithm for the ﬁnite sum setting, although stochastic, guarantees a decrease of the loss function at each iteration. Experiments demonstrate progress on the state-of-the-art for large scale datasets, without the necessity for any manual parameter tuning.},

In this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon’s information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple ﬁxed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably.},

	abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (pomdps) are general models of sequential decision problems in which both actions and observations may be noisy. Many problems of interest can be formulated as pomdps yet the use of pomdps has been limited by the lack of e ective algorithms: optimal algorithms don't scale up and heuristic algorithms often do poorly. In this paper, a new pomdp algorithm is introduced that combines the bene ts of optimal and heuristic procedures producing good solutions quickly even in problems that are large. Like optimal procedures, the procedure rtdp-bel attempts to solve the information mdp, yet like heuristic procedures, it makes decisions in real time following a suitable heuristic function. rtdp-bel is a Real Time Dynamic Programming algorithm 1], namely, a greedy search algorithm that learns to solve mdps by repeatedly updating the heuristic values of the states that are visited. As shown by Barto et al. such updates eventually deliver an optimal behavior provided that the state space is nite and the initial heuristic values are admissible. Since information mdps have in nite state spaces we discretize probabilities and combine them with heuristic values obtained from the underlying mdp. Although the resulting algorithm is not guaranteed to be optimal, experiments over a number of benchmarks suggest that large pomdps are quickly and consistently solved, and that solutions, if not optimal, tend to be very good.},

Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption. However, allowance in design for alternative non-equal correlation structures can and should be made when necessary.},

Paradoxically, the search horizon reachable with this algorithm increases with increasing branching factor. In addition, we present a new algorithm, called Real-Time-A {\textasciitilde}, for interleaving planning and execution. We prove that the algorithm makes locally optimal decisions and is guaranteed to find a solution. We also present a learning version of this algorithm that improves its performance over successive problem solving trials by learning more accurate heuristic values, and prove that the learned values converge to their exact values along every optimal path. These algorithms effectively solve significantly larger problems than have previously been solvable using heuristic evaluation functions.},

	title = {Power and sample size calculations for {fMRI} studies based on the prevalence of active peaks.},
	abstract = {Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suﬀer from low power, and especially for published fMRI experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true eﬀect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically signiﬁcant result indicates a true eﬀect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, ﬁndings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a fMRI study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Speciﬁcally, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average eﬀect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an fMRI experiment, while preserving a predeﬁned statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.},

In this paper, we discuss eight ways to infer causality in fMRI research: Bayesian Nets, Dynamical Causal Modelling, Granger Causality, Likelihood Ratios, Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models, Patel’s Tau, Structural Equation Modelling, and Transfer Entropy.

Despite efforts within the ﬁeld to address issues related to rigor and reproducibility, information about the RDM-related practices and perceptions of neuroimaging researchers remains largely anecdotal. To inform such efforts, we conducted an online survey of active MRI researchers that covered a range of RDM-related topics. Survey questions addressed the type(s) of data collected, tools used for data storage, organization, and analysis, and the degree to which practices are deﬁned and standardized within a research group. Our results demonstrate that neuroimaging data is acquired in multifarious forms, transformed and analyzed using a wide variety of software tools, and that RDM practices and perceptions vary considerably both within and between research groups, with trainees reporting less consistency than faculty. Ratings of the maturity of RDM practices from ad-hoc to reﬁned were relatively high during the data collection and analysis phases of a project and signiﬁcantly lower during the data sharing phase. Perceptions of emerging practices including open access publishing and preregistration were largely positive, but demonstrated little adoption into current practice.},

An alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is the deployment of computational models for inferring on the (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference; focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches –Bayesian model selection and generative embedding – which can link computational models to individual predictions, we review how these methods accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data, and establish a link between a mechanistic, modelbased approach and the statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning.},

	abstract = {Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors in complex latent variables models. However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires signiﬁcant model-speciﬁc analysis. These eﬀorts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a “black box” variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid diﬃcult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We ﬁnd that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

	abstract = {Despite decades of research, the exact ways in which the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) inﬂuences cognitive function have remained mysterious. Anatomically, the OFC is characterized by remarkably broad connectivity to sensory, limbic and subcortical areas, and functional studies have implicated the OFC in a plethora of functions ranging from facial processing to value-guided choice. Notwithstanding such diversity of ﬁndings, much research suggests that one important function of the OFC is to support decision making and reinforcement learning. Here, we describe a novel theory that posits that OFC’s speciﬁc role in decision-making is to provide an up-to-date representation of task-related information, called a state representation. This representation reﬂects a mapping between distinct task states and sensory as well as unobservable information. We summarize evidence supporting the existence of such state representations in rodent and human OFC and argue that forming these state representations provides a crucial scaﬀold that allows animals to eﬃciently perform decision making and reinforcement learning in high-dimensional and partially observable environments. Finally, we argue that our theory oﬀers an integrating framework for linking the diversity of functions ascribed to OFC and is in line with its wide ranging connectivity.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

In this study, we aim to investigate the ability agents possess to track and report the noise inherent in their mental operations, often in the form of conﬁdence judgments. Here, we argue that humans can use uncertainty inherent in their representations of value beliefs to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation. Such uncertainty is reﬂected in explicit conﬁdence judgments. Using a novel variant of a multi-armed bandit paradigm, we studied how beliefs were formed and how uncertainty in the encoding of these value beliefs (belief conﬁdence) evolved over time. We found that people used uncertainty to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation, reﬂected in a higher tendency toward exploration when their conﬁdence in their value representations was low. We furthermore found that value uncertainty can be linked to frameworks of metacognition in decision making in two ways. First, belief conﬁdence drives decision conﬁdence, i.e. people’s evaluation of their own choices. Second, individuals with higher metacognitive insight into their choices were also better at tracing the uncertainty in their environment. Together, these ﬁndings argue that such uncertainty representations play a key role in the context of cognitive control.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/478131},
	abstract = {Most real-world decisions involve a delicate balance between exploring unfamiliar alternatives and committing to the best known option. Uncertainty lies at the core of this “explore-exploit” dilemma, for if all options were perfectly known, there would be no need to explore. Yet despite the prominent role of uncertainty-guided exploration in decision making, evidence for its neural implementation is still sparse. We investigated this question with model-based fMRI (n = 31) using a two-armed bandit task that independently manipulates two forms of uncertainty underlying different exploration strategies. The relative uncertainty between the two options was correlated with BOLD activity in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drove directed exploration, a strategy that adds an uncertainty bonus to each option. The total uncertainty across the two options was correlated with activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drove random exploration, a strategy that increases choice stochasticity in proportion to total uncertainty. The subjective estimates of uncertainty from both regions were predictive of subject choices. Finally, the decision value signal combining relative and total uncertainty to compute choice was reﬂected in motor cortex activity. The variance of this decision value signal scaled with total uncertainty, consistent with a sampling mechanism for random exploration. Overall, these results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.},

	abstract = {How do people decide whether to try out novel options as opposed to tried-and-tested ones? We argue that they infer a novel option's reward from contextual information learned from functional relations and take uncertainty into account when making a decision. We propose a Bayesian optimization model to describe their learning and decision making. This model relies on similarity-based learning of functional relationships between features and rewards, and a choice rule that balances exploration and exploitation by combining predicted rewards and the uncertainty of these predictions. Our model makes two main predictions. First, decision makers who learn functional relationships will generalize based on the learned reward function, choosing novel options only if their predicted reward is high. Second, they will take uncertainty about the function into account, and prefer novel options that can reduce this uncertainty. We test these predictions in three preregistered experiments in which we examine participants' preferences for novel options using a feature-based multi-armed bandit task in which rewards are a noisy function of observable features. Our results reveal strong evidence for functional exploration and moderate evidence for uncertainty-guided exploration. However, whether or not participants chose a novel option also depended on their attention, as well as reflecting on the value of the options. These results advance our understanding of people's reactions in the face of novelty.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/783498},
	abstract = {The explore-exploit dilemma describes the trade off that occurs any time we must choose between exploring unknown options and exploiting options we know well. Implicit in this trade off is how we value future rewards — exploiting is usually better in the short term, but in the longer term the beneﬁts of exploration can be huge. Thus, in theory there should be a tight connection between how much people value future rewards, i.e. how much they discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards, and how likely they are to explore, with less ‘temporal discounting’ associated with more exploration. By measuring individual differences in temporal discounting and correlating them with explore-exploit behavior, we tested whether this theoretical prediction holds in practice. We used the 27item Delay-Discounting Questionnaire to estimate temporal discounting and the Horizon Task to quantify two strategies of explore-exploit behavior: directed exploration, where information drives exploration by choice, and random exploration, where behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. We ﬁnd a clear correlation between temporal discounting and directed exploration, with more temporal discounting leading to less directed exploration. Conversely, we ﬁnd no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration. Unexpectedly, we ﬁnd that the relationship with directed exploration appears to be driven by a correlation between temporal discounting and uncertainty seeking at short time horizons, rather than information seeking at long horizons. Taken together our results suggest a nuanced relationship between temporal discounting and explore-exploit behavior that may be mediated by multiple factors.},

	abstract = {This paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},

Such selection effects can lead to substantial bias in estimates of effect magnitude. Research on the selection process suggests that much of the selection occurs because researchers, reviewers and editors view the results of studies as more conclusive when they are more highly statistically significant. This suggests a model of the selection process that depends on effect magnitude via the p-value or significance level. A model of the selection process involving a step function relating the p-value to the probability of selection is introduced in the context of a random effects model for meta-analysis. The model permits estimation of a weight function representing selection along the mean and variance of effects. Some ideas for graphical procedures and a test for publication selection are also introduced. The method is then applied to a meta-analysis of test validity studies.},

Across a total of 214 studies included in the main sample, the mean EC effect was d ϭ .52, with a 95\% confidence interval of .466 –.582. As estimated from a random-effects model, about 70\% of the variance in effect sizes were attributable to true systematic variation rather than sampling error. Moderator analyses were conducted to partially explain this variation, both as a function of concrete aspects of the procedural implementation and as a function of the abstract aspects of the relation between CS and US. Among a range of other findings, EC effects were stronger for high than for low contingency awareness, for supraliminal than for subliminal US presentation, for postacquisition than for postextinction effects, and for self-report than for implicit measures. These findings are discussed with regard to the procedural boundary conditions of EC and theoretical accounts about the mental processes underlying EC.},

From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete statespace models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.},

	abstract = {Maladaptive risk taking can have severe individual and societal consequences; thus, individual differences are prominent targets for intervention and prevention. Although brain activation has been shown to be associated with individual differences in risk taking, the directionality of the reported brain–behavior associations is less clear. Here, we argue that one aspect contributing to the mixed results is the low convergence between risk-taking measures, especially between the behavioral tasks used to elicit neural functional markers. To address this question, we analyzed within-participant neuroimaging data for two widely used risk-taking tasks collected from the imaging subsample of the Basel–Berlin Risk Study (N = 116 young human adults). Focusing on core brain regions implicated in risk taking (nucleus accumbens, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex), for the two tasks, we examined group-level activation for risky versus safe choices, as well as associations between local functional markers and various risk-related outcomes, including psychometrically derived risk preference factors. While we observed common group-level activation in the two tasks (notably increased nucleus accumbens activation), individual differences analyses support the idea that the presence and directionality of associations between brain activation and risk taking varies as a function of the risk-taking measures used to capture individual differences. Our results have methodological implications for the use of brain markers for intervention or prevention.},

	abstract = {Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have consistently been used in the investigation of auditory and cognitive processing in the research and clinical laboratories. There is currently no consensus on the choice of appropriate reference for auditory ERPs. The most commonly used references in auditory ERP research are the mathematically linked-mastoids (LM) and average referencing (AVG). Since LM and AVG referencing procedures do not solve the issue of electrically-neutral reference, Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) was developed to create a neutral reference for EEG recordings. The aim of the current research is to compare the inﬂuence of the reference on amplitude and latency of auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) as a function of magnitude of frequency deviance across three commonly used electrode montages (16, 32, and 64-channel) using REST, LM, and AVG reference procedures. The current study was designed to determine if the three reference methods capture the variation in amplitude and latency of MMN with the deviance magnitude. We recorded MMN from 12 normal hearing young adults in an auditory oddball paradigm with 1,000 Hz pure tone as standard and 1,030, 1,100, and 1,200 Hz as small, medium and large frequency deviants, respectively. The EEG data recorded to these sounds was re-referenced using REST, LM, and AVG methods across 16-, 32-, and 64-channel EEG electrode montages. Results revealed that while the latency of MMN decreased with increment in frequency of deviant sounds, no effect of frequency deviance was present for amplitude of MMN. There was no effect of referencing procedure on the experimental effect tested. The amplitude of MMN was largest when the ERP was computed using LM referencing and the REST referencing produced the largest amplitude of MMN for 64-channel montage. There was no effect of electrode-montage on AVG referencing induced ERPs. Contrary to our predictions, the results suggest that the auditory MMN elicited as a function of increments in frequency deviance does not depend on the choice of referencing procedure. The results also suggest that auditory ERPs generated using REST referencing is contingent on the electrode arrays more than the AVG referencing.},

	abstract = {As statisticians and scientists consider a world beyond p {\textless} 0.05, it is important to not lose sight of how we got to this point. Although significance testing and p-values are often presented as prescriptive procedures, they came about through a process of refinement and extension to other disciplines. Ronald A. Fisher and his contemporaries formalized these methods in the early twentieth century and Fisher’s 1925 Statistical Methods for Research Workers brought the techniques to experimentalists in a variety of disciplines. Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p {\textless} 0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae. Incorporating history enables students, practitioners, and statisticians to treat the discipline as an ongoing endeavor, crafted by fallible humans, and provides a deeper understanding of the subject and its consequences for science and society.},

To date, this research has focused largely on deep neural networks trained using supervised learning, in tasks such as image classiﬁcation. However, there is another area of recent AI work which has so far received less attention from neuroscientists, but which may have profound neuroscientiﬁc implications: deep reinforcement learning. Deep RL oﬀers a comprehensive framework for studying the interplay among learning, representation and decision-making, oﬀering to the brain sciences a new set of research tools and a wide range of novel hypotheses. In the present review, we provide a high-level introduction to deep RL, discuss some of its initial applications to neuroscience, and survey its wider implications for research on brain and behavior, concluding with a list of opportunities for next-stage research.},

	abstract = {Collaborative networks and data sharing initiatives are broadening the opportunities for the advancement of science. These initiatives offer greater transparency in science, with the opportunity for external research groups to reproduce, replicate, and extend research findings. Further, larger datasets offer the opportunity to identify homogeneous patterns within subgroups of individuals, where these patterns may be obscured by the heterogeneity of the neurobiological measure in smaller samples. However, data sharing and data pooling initiatives are not without their challenges, especially with new laws that may at first glance appear quite restrictive for open science initiatives. Interestingly, what is key to some of these new laws (i.e, the European Union's general data protection regulation) is that they provide greater control of data to those who “give” their data for research purposes. Thus, the most important element in data sharing is allowing the participants to make informed decisions about how they want their data to be used, and, within the law of the specific country, to follow the participants' wishes. This framework encompasses obtaining thorough informed consent and allowing the participant to determine the extent that they want their data shared, many of the ethical and legal obstacles are reduced to just monsters under the bed. In this manuscript we discuss the many options and obstacles for data sharing, from fully open, to federated learning, to fully closed. Importantly, we highlight the intersection of data sharing, privacy, and data ownership and highlight specific examples that we believe are informative to the neuroimaging community.},

	abstract = {Knowledge abstracted from previous experiences can be transferred to aid new learning. Here, we asked whether such abstract knowledge immediately guides the replay of new experiences. We ﬁrst trained participants on a rule deﬁning an ordering of objects and then presented a novel set of objects in a scrambled order. Across two studies, we observed that representations of these novel objects were reactivated during a subsequent rest. As in rodents, human ‘‘replay’’ events occurred in sequences accelerated in time, compared to actual experience, and reversed their direction after a reward. Notably, replay did not simply recapitulate visual experience, but followed instead a sequence implied by learned abstract knowledge. Furthermore, each replay contained more than sensory representations of the relevant objects. A sensory code of object representations was preceded 50 ms by a code factorized into sequence position and sequence identity. We argue that this factorized representation facilitates the generalization of a previously learned structure to new objects.},

We investigated whether replay of nonspatial sequences can be detected noninvasively in the human hippocampus. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while resting after performing a decision-making task with sequential structure. Hippocampal fMRI patterns recorded at rest reflected sequentiality of previously experienced task states, with consecutive patterns corresponding to nearby states. Hippocampal sequentiality correlated with the fidelity of task representations recorded in the orbitofrontal cortex during decision-making, which were themselves related to better task performance. Our findings suggest that hippocampal replay may be important for building representations of complex, abstract tasks elsewhere in the brain and establish feasibility of investigating fast replay signals with fMRI.},

We recommend researchers (a) disclose how the research stimuli were selected and (b) uncover and report the diagnosticity of the stimuli for the models being tested. To demonstrate the importance of this recommendation, we present lessons learned from model testing in judgment and decision-making research. We focus on the documentation and reporting of model-stimulus relationships, specifically diagnosticity, and demonstrate how transparent documentation of diagnosticity facilitates interpretation of the evidence it generates.

In bandit problems, people must choose between a set of alternatives, each with different unknown reward rates, to maximize the total reward they receive over a fixed number of trials. A key feature of the task is that it challenges people to balance the exploration of unfamiliar choices with the exploitation of familiar ones. We use a Bayesian model of optimal decision-making on the task, in which how people balance exploration with exploitation depends on their assumptions about the distribution of reward rates. We also use Bayesian model selection measures that assess how well people adhere to an optimal decision process, compared to simpler heuristic decision strategies. Using these models, we make inferences about the decision-making of 451 participants who completed a set of bandit problems, and relate various measures of their performance to other psychological variables, including psychometric assessments of cognitive abilities and personality traits. We find clear evidence of individual differences in the way the participants made decisions on the bandit problems, and some interesting correlations with measures of general intelligence.},

Given an admissible target measure, we show the existence of the best approximation, with respect to this divergence, from certain sets of Gaussian measures and Gaussian mixtures. The asymptotic behavior of such best approximations is then studied in the small parameter limit where the measure concentrates; this asympotic behavior is characterized using Γ-convergence. The theory developed is then applied to understand the frequentist consistency of Bayesian inverse problems in ﬁnite dimensions. For a ﬁxed realization of additive observational noise, we show the asymptotic normality of the posterior measure in the small noise limit. Taking into account the randomness of the noise, we prove a Bernstein–Von Mises type result for the posterior measure.},

	abstract = {Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artiﬁcial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.},

	abstract = {In reinforcement learning, we can learn a model of future observations and rewards, and use it to plan the agent’s next actions. However, jointly modeling future observations can be computationally expensive or even intractable if the observations are high-dimensional (e.g. images). For this reason, previous works have considered partial models, which model only part of the observation. In this paper, we show that partial models can be causally incorrect: they are confounded by the observations they don’t model, and can therefore lead to incorrect planning. To address this, we introduce a general family of partial models that are provably causally correct, yet remain fast because they do not need to fully model future observations.},

They are obtained by considering a maximum likelihood (ML) solution corresponding to some given distributions of the sources and relaxing this assumption afterward. The ﬁrst method is specially adapted to temporally independent non-Gaussian sources and is based on the use of nonlinear separating functions. The second method is specially adapted to correlated sources with distinct spectra and is based on the use of linear separating ﬁlters. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the methods has been made. A simple procedure for optimally choosing the separating functions from a given linear space of functions is proposed. Further, in the second method, a simple implementation based on the simultaneous diagonalization of two symmetric matrices is provided. Finally, some numerical and simulation results are given, illustrating the performance of the method and the good agreement between the experiments and the theory.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is ﬁnding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to ﬁnd a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject. ᭧ 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept oflCA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.},

	abstract = {This essay addresses Cartesian duality and how its implicit dialectic might be repaired using physics and information theory. Our agenda is to describe a key distinction in the physical sciences that may provide a foundation for the distinction between mind and matter, and between sentient and intentional systems. From this perspective, it becomes tenable to talk about the physics of sentience and ‘forces’ that underwrite our beliefs (in the sense of probability distributions represented by our internal states), which may ground our mental states and consciousness. We will refer to this view as Markovian monism, which entails two claims: (1) fundamentally, there is only one type of thing and only one type of irreducible property (hence monism). (2) All systems possessing a Markov blanket have properties that are relevant for understanding the mind and consciousness: if such systems have mental properties, then they have them partly by virtue of possessing a Markov blanket (hence Markovian). Markovian monism rests upon the information geometry of random dynamic systems. In brief, the information geometry induced in any system—whose internal states can be distinguished from external states—must acquire a dual aspect. This dual aspect concerns the (intrinsic) information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states and a separate (extrinsic) information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameterised by internal states. We call these intrinsic (i.e., mechanical, or state-based) and extrinsic (i.e., Markovian, or belief-based) information geometries, respectively. Although these mathematical notions may sound complicated, they are fairly straightforward to handle, and may oﬀer a means through which to frame the origins of consciousness.},

	abstract = {The canonical computational model for the cognitive process underlying two-alternative forced-choice decision making is the so-called drift–diﬀusion model (DDM). In this model, a decision variable keeps track of the integrated diﬀerence in sensory evidence for two competing alternatives. Here I extend the notion of a drift–diﬀusion process to multiple alternatives. The competition between n alternatives takes place in a linear subspace of n – 1 dimensions; that is, there are n – 1 decision variables, which are coupled through correlated noise sources. I derive the multiple-alternative DDM starting from a system of coupled, linear ﬁring rate equations. I also show that a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test for multiple alternatives is, in fact, equivalent to these same linear DDMs, but with time-varying thresholds. If the original neuronal system is nonlinear, one can once again derive a model describing a lower-dimensional diﬀusion process. The dynamics of the nonlinear DDM can be recast as the motion of a particle on a potential, the general form of which is given analytically for an arbitrary number of alternatives.},

	abstract = {During learning, the brain modifies synapses to improve behaviour. In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

	abstract = {The general problem of computing posterior probabilities in Bayesian networks is NP-hard (Cooper 1990). However e cient algorithms are often possible for particular applications by exploiting problem structures. It is well understood that the key to the materialization of such a possibility is to make use of conditional independence and work with factorizations of joint probabilities rather than joint probabilities themselves. Di erent exact approaches can be characterized in terms of their choices of factorizations. We propose a new approach which adopts a straightforward way for factorizing joint probabilities. In comparison with the clique tree propagation approach, our approach is very simple. It allows the pruning of irrelevant variables, it accommodates changes to the knowledge base more easily. it is easier to implement. More importantly, it can be adapted to utilize both intercausal independence and conditional independence in one uniform framework. On the other hand, clique tree propagation is better in terms of facilitating precomputations.},

	abstract = {"One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science"--},

	abstract = {Many applied researchers of limited dependent variable models found it disadvantageous that a widely accepted Pseudo-R2 does not exist for this type of estimation. The paper provides guidance for researchers in choosing a Pseudo-R 2 in the binary probit case. The starting point is that R 2 is best understood in the ordinary least squares (OLS) case with continuous data, which is chosen as the reference situation. It is considered which Pseudo-R z is best able to mimic the OLS-R 2. The results are surprisingly clear: a measure suggested by McKelveyZavoina performs the best under our criterion. However, in the more likely case of low PseudoRZ's, a normalization of a measure proposed by Aldrich-Nelson which we suggest is almost as good as the McKelvey-Zavoina, and is in general easier to calculate. We also show that if the underlying R 2 is predicted using cubic regressions given the Pseudo-R 2, all measures perform much better.},

We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.},

	abstract = {In everyday life, our behavior varies on a continuum from automatic and habitual to deliberate and goal-directed. Recent evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is an open question how one can computationally model the brain’s balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for control of a partially observable Markov decision process that enables conjoint learning of habits and reward structure in a contextspecific manner. In this model, habit learning corresponds to an updating of priors over policies and interacts with the learning of the outcome contingencies. Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic inference, which effectively provides a simple explanation of how the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed control. We illustrated the resulting behavior using agentbased simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of devaluation, extinction, and renewal experiments, as well as the so-called two-step task which is typically used with human participants. In addition, we show how a single parameter, the habitual tendency, can explain individual differences in habit learning and the balancing between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss the link of the proposed model to other habit learning models and implications for understanding specific phenomena in substance use disorder.},

	abstract = {We describe a project-based introduction to reproducible and collaborative neuroimaging analysis. Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of speciﬁc neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with a superﬁcial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefﬁcient, and inaccurate approach to analysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial open-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MR scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efﬁciency, and collaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in working reproducibly on real scientiﬁc questions. We propose that a course on this model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We believe it will also serve as a model for teaching efﬁcient and reproducible research in other ﬁelds of computational science.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience research is undergoing a minor revolution. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.
METHODS In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 fulllength spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

Drs. Polack and Thomas contributed equally to this article. This article was published on December 10, 2020, at NEJM.org.
RESULTS A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95\% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95\% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100\%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2034577 Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
CONCLUSIONS A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95\% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.)},

	abstract = {This letter considers a class of biologically plausible cost functions for neural networks, where the same cost function is minimized by both neural activity and plasticity. We show that such cost functions can be cast as a variational bound on model evidence under an implicit generative model. Using generative models based on partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDP), we show that neural activity and plasticity perform Bayesian inference and learning, respectively, by maximizing model evidence. Using mathematical and numerical analyses, we establish the formal equivalence between neural network cost functions and variational free energy under some prior beliefs about latent states that generate inputs. These prior beliefs are determined by particular constants (e.g., thresholds) that define the cost function. This means that the Bayes optimal encoding of latent or hidden states is achieved when the network's implicit priors match the process that generates its inputs. This equivalence is potentially important because it suggests that any hyperparameter of a neural network can itself be optimized—by minimization with respect to variational free energy. Furthermore, it enables one to characterize a neural network formally, in terms of its prior beliefs.},

Here, we present a combination of two approaches for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis that together result in substantial improvements of the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics. The first approach is to create novel cluster definitions that optimize sensitivity to plausible effect patterns. The second is to adopt a new approach to combine test statistics with different sensitivity profiles, which we call the min(p) method. These innovations are made possible by using the randomization inference framework. In this article, we report on a set of simulations and analyses of real task fMRI data that demonstrate (a) that the proposed methods control the false-alarm rate, (b) that the sensitivity profiles of cluster-based test statistics vary depending on the cluster defining thresholds and cluster definitions, and (c) that the min(p) method for combining these test statistics results in a drastic increase of sensitivity (up to fivefold), compared to existing fMRI analysis methods. This increase in sensitivity is not at the expense of the spatial specificity of the inference.},

Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

	abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

We obtained magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements from subjects performing a working memory (WM) task during a withinsubject, placebo-controlled, pharmacological (dopaminergic) challenge. By applying dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a Bayesian technique for neuronal system identiﬁcation [6], to MEG signals from prefrontal cortex, we demonstrate that it is possible to infer synaptic signaling by speciﬁc ion channels in behaving humans. Dopamineinduced enhancement of WM performance was accompanied by signiﬁcant changes in MEG signal power, and a DCM assay disclosed related changes in synaptic signaling. By estimating the contribution of ionotropic receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and GABAA) to the observed spectral response, we demonstrate changes in their function commensurate with the synaptic effects of dopamine. The validity of our model is reinforced by a striking quantitative effect on NMDA and AMPA receptor signaling that predicted behavioral improvement over subjects. Our results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a novel framework for inferring, noninvasively, neuromodulatory inﬂuences on ion channel signaling via speciﬁc ionotropic receptors, providing a window on the hidden synaptic events mediating discrete psychological processes in humans.},

It is not known whether brain regions implicated in decision making, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), use a stored model of the task structure to guide choice (model-based decision making) or merely learn action or state values without assuming higher-order structure as in standard reinforcement learning. To discriminate between these possibilities, we scanned human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a simple decision-making task with higher-order structure, probabilistic reversal learning. We found that neural activity in a key decision-making region, the vmPFC, was more consistent with a computational model that exploits higher-order structure than with simple reinforcement learning. These results suggest that brain regions, such as the vmPFC, use an abstract model of task structure to guide behavioral choice, computations that may underlie the human capacity for complex social interactions and abstract strategizing.},

But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives-which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry-require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

Here, we explored the dlPFC computations related to updating current beliefs during stochastic reversal learning. We recorded the activity of populations up to 1,000 neurons, simultaneously, in two male macaques while they executed a two-armed bandit reversal learning task. Behavioral analyses using a Bayesian framework showed that animals inferred reversals and switched their choice preference rapidly, rather than slowly updating choice values, consistent with state inference. Furthermore, dlPFC neural populations accurately encoded choice preference switches. These results suggest that prefrontal neurons dynamically encode decisions associated with Bayesian subjective values, highlighting the role of the PFC in representing a belief about the current state of the world.},

However, its relevance for somatosensory processing is unclear. In the present study we test the hypothesis that cortical somatosensory processing exhibits dynamics that are consistent with Bayesian accounts of brain function. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the cortical encoding of Bayesian surprise, a recently proposed marker of Bayesian perceptual learning, using EEG data recorded from 15 subjects. Capitalizing on a somatosensory mismatch roving paradigm, we performed computational single-trial modeling of evoked somatosensory potentials for the entire peri-stimulus time period in source space. By means of Bayesian model selection, we ﬁnd that, at 140 ms post-stimulus onset, secondary somatosensory cortex represents Bayesian surprise rather than stimulus change, which is the conventional marker of EEG mismatch responses. In contrast, at 250 ms, right inferior frontal cortex indexes stimulus change. Finally, at 360 ms, our analyses indicate additional perceptual learning attributable to medial cingulate cortex. In summary, the present study provides novel evidence for anatomical-temporal/functional segregation in human somatosensory processing that is consistent with the Bayesian brain hypothesis.},

Algorithms based on uncertainty bonuses predict a change in response bias as a function of uncertainty, whereas algorithms based on sampling predict a change in response slope.

	doi = {10.1038/nature04766},
	abstract = {Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions.},

We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing ﬁxed budget and ﬁxed conﬁdence algorithms.},

	abstract = {Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining the most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms that generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread application in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling (DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects has relied on simple (ﬁxed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or outliers. In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects methods for BMS at the between-subject or group level. These methods provide inference on model-space using a classical and Bayesian perspective respectively. First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses the log model evidence as a subject-speciﬁc summary statistic. This enables one to use analysis of variance to test for differences in log-evidences over models, relative to intersubject differences. We then consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe a novel hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability density on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes method rests on treating the model as a random variable and estimating the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which describes the probabilities for all models considered. These probabilities then deﬁne a multinomial distribution over model space, allowing one to compute how likely it is that a speciﬁc model generated the data of a randomly chosen subject as well as the exceedance probability of one model being more likely than any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data, we show that optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities, given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more informative and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests of the log-evidences. In particular, we found that the hierarchical Bayesian approach is considerably more robust than either of the other approaches in the presence of outliers. We expect that this new random effects method will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not only in the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g. comparing different source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or selecting among competing computational models of learning and decision-making.},

Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%. We find this policy—author remission of data and code postpublication upon request—an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the conﬁdence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability.

In this paper, a method is proposed to approximately standardize the reference of scalp EEG recordings to a point at inﬁnity. This method is based on the fact that the use of scalp potentials to determine the neural electrical activities or their equivalent sources does not depend on the reference, so we may approximately reconstruct the equivalent sources from scalp EEG recordings with a scalp point or average reference. Then the potentials referenced at inﬁnity are approximately reconstructed from the equivalent sources. As a point at inﬁnity is far from all the possible neural sources, this method may be considered as a reference electrode standardization technique (REST). The simulation studies performed with assumed neural sources included effects of electrode number, volume conductor model and noise on the performance of REST, and the signiﬁcance of REST in EEG temporal analysis. The results showed that REST is potentially very effective for the most important superﬁcial cortical region and the standardization could be especially important in recovering the temporal information of EEG recordings.},

	abstract = {People can learn about the probabilistic consequences of their actions in two ways: One is by consulting descriptions of an action’s consequences and probabilities (e.g., reading up on a medication’s side effects). The other is by personally experiencing the probabilistic consequences of an action (e.g., beta testing software). In principle, people taking each route can reach analogous states of knowledge and consequently make analogous decisions. In the last dozen years, however, research has demonstrated systematic discrepancies between description- and experienced-based choices. This descriptionexperience gap has been attributed to factors including reliance on a small set of experience, the impact of recency, and different weighting of probability information in the two decision types. In this meta-analysis focusing on studies using the sampling paradigm of decisions from experience, we evaluated these and other determinants of the decision– experience gap by reference to more than 70,000 choices made by more than 6,000 participants. We found, first, a robust description-experience gap but also a key moderator, namely, problem structure. Second, the largest determinant of the gap was reliance on small samples and the associated sampling error: free to terminate search, individuals explored too little to experience all possible outcomes. Third, the gap persisted when sampling error was basically eliminated, suggesting other determinants. Fourth, the occurrence of recency was contingent on decision makers’ autonomy to terminate search, consistent with the notion of optional stopping. Finally, we found indications of different probability weighting in decisions from experience versus decisions from description when the problem structure involved a risky and a safe option.},

	abstract = {The Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (AD ACL) is a multidimensional self-rating test constructed and extensively validated for rapid assessments of momentary activation or arousal states. The two core dimensions, energetic arousal (including tiredness) and tense arousal (including calmness) have been replicated repeatedly. They bear a complex relationship to each other involving positive and negative correlations at different levels of intensity. The dimensions are associated with a variety of arousal-related characteristics, including physiological changes, sleep-wake cycles, exercise effects, cognitive and information processing functions, various mood states, and a number of concomitants of stress. Finally, in a reported empirical study designed to investigate the somewhat uncommon self-rating format of this check list, alternative rating scales were employed with the same adjective descriptors. Factor analyses of respondents' ratings indicated that the factor structure of activation descriptors remained essentially the same with each scale. In this context, the importance of the underlying arousal model in relation to the activation descriptors is discussed.},

Focusing on the psychometrics of momentary affect, particularly happiness and sadness, and using a simulation study, a large-scale data set, and 2 experiments manipulating affect, we plot a map of affective space that departs from the consensus. One key departure is the ﬁnding that happiness and sadness are not bipolar opposites. Another is that nonuniform skewness plays a major role in studies of affective structure, but can be addressed with appropriate analyses.},

However, biomedical researchers are rewarded for innovation, and not for confirmation, and confirmatory research is often stigmatized as unoriginal and as a consequence faces barriers to publication. As a result, the current biomedical literature is dominated by exploration, which to complicate matters further is often disguised as confirmation. Only recently scientists and the public have begun to realize that high-profile research results in biomedicine can often not be replicated. Consequently, confirmation has become central stage in the quest to safeguard the robustness of research findings. Research which is pushing the boundaries of or challenges what is currently known must necessarily result in a plethora of false positive results. Thus, since discovery, the driving force of scientific progress, is unavoidably linked to high false positive rates and cannot support confirmatory inference, dedicated confirmatory investigation is needed for pivotal results. In this chapter I will argue that the tension between the two modes of research, exploration and confirmation, can be resolved if we conceptually and practically separate them. I will discuss the idiosyncrasies of exploratory and confirmatory studies, with a focus on the specific features of their design, analysis, and interpretation.},

	abstract = {We examined the role of working-memory (WM) in dynamic decision-making by having participants perform decision-making tasks under single-task or dual-task conditions. In two experiments participants performed dynamic decision-making tasks where they chose one of two options on each trial. The Decreasing option always gave a larger immediate reward, but caused future rewards for both options to decrease. The Increasing option always gave a smaller immediate reward, but caused future rewards for both options to increase. In each experiment we manipulated the reward structure such that the Decreasing option was the optimal choice in one condition and the Increasing option was the optimal choice in the other condition. Behavioral results indicated that Dual-task participants selected the immediately rewarding Decreasing option more often, while Single-task participants selected the Increasing option more often, regardless of which option was optimal. Thus, Dual-task participants performed worse on one type of task but better on the other type. Modeling results showed that Single-task participants’ data was most often best fit by a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift (WSLS) rule-based model that tracked differences across trials, while Dual-task participants’ data was most often best fit by a Softmax reinforcement learning model that tracked recency-weighted average rewards for each option. This suggests that manipulating WM load affects the degree to which participants focus on the immediate versus delayed consequences of their actions and whether they employ a rule-based WSLS strategy, but it does not necessarily affect how well people weigh the immediate versus delayed benefits when determining the long-term utility of each option.},

	abstract = {Involvement of dopamine in regulating exploration during decision-making has long been hypothesized, but direct causal evidence in humans is still lacking. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue. Thirty-one healthy male participants performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design under three drug conditions: 150 mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2 mg of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. Choices were best explained by an extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, directed exploration and random exploration. Modeling revealed attenuated directed exploration under L-dopa, while neural signatures of exploration, exploitation and prediction error were unaffected. Instead, L-dopa attenuated neural representations of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that dopamine modulates how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during decision-making.},

Despite the importance for behavior and survival, much remains unknown about how these dependencies are learned, particularly for somatosensation. As surprise signalling about novel observations indicates a mismatch between one’s beliefs and the world, it has been hypothesized that surprise computation plays an important role in perceptual learning. By analyzing EEG data from human participants receiving sequences of tactile stimulation, we compare different formulations of surprise and investigate the employed underlying learning model. Our results indicate that the brain estimates transitions between observations. Furthermore, we identified different signatures of surprise computation and thereby provide a dissociation of the neural correlates of belief inadequacy and belief updating. Specifically, early surprise responses from around 70ms were found to signal the need for changes to the model, with encoding of its subsequent updating occurring from around 140ms. These results provide insights into how somatosensory surprise signals may contribute to the learning of environmental statistics.},

            Decentralized research data management (dRDM) systems handle digital research objects across participating nodes without critically relying on central services. We present four perspectives in defense of dRDM, illustrating that, in contrast to centralized or federated research data management solutions, a dRDM system based on heterogeneous but interoperable components can offer a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and adaptive infrastructure for scientific stakeholders: An individual scientist or laboratory, a research institute, a domain data archive or cloud computing platform, and a collaborative multisite consortium. All perspectives share the use of a common, self-contained, portable data structure as an abstraction from current technology and service choices. In conjunction, the four perspectives review how varying requirements of independent scientific stakeholders can be addressed by a scalable, uniform dRDM solution and present a working system as an exemplary implementation.},

	abstract = {Multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis is often concerned with determining whether there exists a significant population-wide ’activation’ in a comparison between two or more conditions. Typically this is assessed by testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates (COPE) against zero in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. In this work we investigate several aspects of this type of analysis. First, we study the effects of sample size on the sensitivity and reliability of the group analysis, allowing us to evaluate the ability of small sampled studies to effectively capture population-level effects of interest. Second, we assess the difference in sensitivity and reliability when using volumetric or surface based data. Third, we investigate potential biases in estimating effect sizes as a function of sample size. To perform this analysis we utilize the task-based fMRI data from the 500-subject release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We treat the complete collection of subjects (N = 491) as our population of interest, and perform a single-subject analysis on each subject in the population. We investigate the ability to recover population level effects using a subset of the population and standard analytical techniques. Our study shows that sample sizes of 40 are generally able to detect regions with high effect sizes (Cohen’s d \&gt; 0.8), while sample sizes closer to 80 are required to reliably recover regions with medium effect sizes (0.5 \&lt; d \&lt; 0.8). We find little difference in results when using volumetric or surface based data with respect to standard mass-univariate group analysis. Finally, we conclude that special care is needed when estimating effect sizes, particularly for small sample sizes.},

	abstract = {A wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this "methodological plurality" comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software packages, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. Neuroimaging is currently experiencing a surge in initiatives to improve research practices and ensure that all conclusions inferred from an fMRI study are replicable. In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publicly shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyze, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 - 0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our own efforts to make this research reproducible.},

              Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions
              1–3
              (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping
              4
              (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations
              5,6
              . Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

However, several studies questioned the validity of the standard clusterwise inference in fMRI analyses and observed inflated false positive rates. In particular, Eklund et al.

In this study, we summarize the assumptions in RFT clusterwise inference and propose new parametric ways to approximate the distribution of the cluster size by properly combining the limiting distribution of the cluster size given by Nosko [Local structure of Gaussian random fields in the vicinity of high-level shines, Sov. Math. Dokl. 10 (1969), pp. 1481–1484] and the expected value of the cluster size provided by Friston et al. [Assessing the significance of focal activations using their spatial extent, Hum.

Results show that our method produces a more stringent estimation of cluster extent size, which leads to a better control of false positive rates.},

However, this “methodological plurality” comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publicly shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL, and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyse, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. Qualitatively we find similarities between packages, backed up by Neurosynth association analyses that correlate similar words and phrases to all three software package's unthresholded results for each of the studies we reanalyse. However, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 to 0.684 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our efforts to make this research reproducible.},

	abstract = {Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on the ability to map brain function using task-based fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential methods is still being characterized. A recent landmark study by Eklund and colleagues showed that popular multiple comparison corrections based on cluster extent suffer from unexpectedly low speciﬁcity (i.e., high false positive rate). Yet that study’s focus on speciﬁcity, while important, is incomplete. The validity of a method depends also on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate or power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric cluster correction by resampling real data from ﬁve tasks in the Human Connectome Project and comparing results with those from the full “ground truth” datasets (n ¼ 480–493). Critically, we found that sensitivity after correction is lower than may be practical for many fMRI applications. In particular, sensitivity to medium-sized effects ({\textbar}Cohen’s d{\textbar} ¼ 0.5) was less than 20\% across tasks on average, about three times smaller than without any correction. Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a spatial bias in sensitivity that was independent of effect size. In comparison, correction based on the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic approximately doubled sensitivity across tasks but increased spatial bias. These results suggest that we have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg in the activation-mapping literature due to our goal of limiting the familywise error rate through cluster extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore conclude with a list of modern strategies to boost sensitivity while maintaining respectable speciﬁcity in future investigations.},

	abstract = {Arguments that machine learning (ML) is facing a reproducibility and replication crisis suggest that some published claims in ML research cannot be taken at face value. These concerns inspire analogies to the replication crisis aﬀecting the social and medical sciences. They also inspire calls for the integration of statistical approaches to causal inference and predictive modeling. A deeper understanding of what reproducibility concerns in supervised ML research have in common with the replication crisis in experimental science puts the new concerns in perspective, and helps researchers avoid “the worst of both worlds,” where ML researchers begin borrowing methodologies from explanatory modeling without understanding their limitations and vice versa. We contribute a comparative analysis of concerns about inductive learning that arise in causal attribution as exempliﬁed in psychology versus predictive modeling as exempliﬁed in ML. We identify themes that re-occur in reform discussions, like overreliance on asymptotic theory and non-credible beliefs about real-world data generating processes. We argue that in both ﬁelds, claims from learning are implied to generalize outside the speciﬁc environment studied (e.g., the input dataset or subject sample, modeling implementation, etc.) but are often diﬃcult to refute due to underspeciﬁcation of key parts of the learning pipeline. In particular, errors being acknowledged in ML expose cracks in long-held beliefs that optimizing predictive accuracy using huge datasets absolves one from having to consider a true data generating process or formally represent uncertainty in performance claims. We conclude by discussing risks that arise when sources of errors are misdiagnosed and the need to acknowledge the role of human inductive biases in learning and reform.},

From the early 1990s, non-invasive functional neuroimaging, coupled with parallel developments in the cognitive neurosciences, seemed to signal a new era of neurobiologically grounded diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Yet, despite three decades of intense neuroimaging research, we still lack a neurobiological account for any psychiatric condition. Likewise, functional neuroimaging plays no role in clinical decision making.

	abstract = {Inference in neuroimaging typically occurs at the level of focal brain areas or circuits. Yet, increasingly, well-powered studies paint a much richer picture of broad-scale effects distributed throughout the brain, suggesting that many focal reports may only reflect the tip of the iceberg of underlying effects. How focal versus broad-scale perspectives influence the inferences we make has not yet been comprehensively evaluated using real data. Here, we compare sensitivity and specificity across procedures representing multiple levels of inference using an empirical benchmarking procedure that resamples task-based connectomes from the Human Connectome Project dataset (∼1,000 subjects, 7 tasks, 3 resampling group sizes, 7 inferential procedures). Only broad-scale (network and whole brain) procedures obtained the traditional 80\% statistical power level to detect an average effect, reflecting {\textgreater}20\% more statistical power than focal (edge and cluster) procedures. Power also increased substantially for false discovery rate– compared with familywise error rate–controlling procedures. The downsides are fairly limited; the loss in specificity for broad-scale and FDR procedures was relatively modest compared to the gains in power. Furthermore, the broad-scale methods we introduce are simple, fast, and easy to use, providing a straightforward starting point for researchers. This also points to the promise of more sophisticated broad-scale methods for not only functional connectivity but also related fields, including task-based activation. Altogether, this work demonstrates that shifting the scale of inference and choosing FDR control are both immediately attainable and can help remedy the issues with statistical power plaguing typical studies in the field.},

How people are nevertheless able to solve novel problems when their actions have long-reaching consequences is thus a long-standing question in cognitive science. To address this question, we propose a model of resource-constrained planning that allows us to derive optimal planning strategies. We ﬁnd that previously proposed heuristics such as best-ﬁrst search are near-optimal under some circumstances, but not others. In a mouse-tracking paradigm, we show that people adapt their planning strategies accordingly, planning in a manner that is broadly consistent with the optimal model but not with any single heuristic model. We also ﬁnd systematic deviations from the optimal model that might result from additional cognitive constraints that are yet to be uncovered.},

	abstract = {ANOVA—the workhorse of experimental psychology—seems well understood in that behavioral sciences have agreedupon contrasts and reporting conventions. Yet, we argue this consensus hides considerable flaws in common ANOVA procedures, and these flaws become especially salient in the within-subject and mixed-model cases. The main thesis is that these flaws are in model specification. The specifications underlying common use are deficient from a substantive perspective, that is, they do not match reality in behavioral experiments. The problem, in particular, is that specifications rely on coincidental rather than robust statements about reality. We provide specifications that avoid making arguments based on coincidences, and note these Bayes factor model comparisons among these specifications are already convenient in the BayesFactor package. Finally, we argue that model specification necessarily and critically reflects substantive concerns, and, consequently, is ultimately the responsibility of substantive researchers.

In the current exploratory study, we introduce an information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task to model such situations and obtained choice data on this task from 24 participants. To arbitrate between different decision-making strategies that participants may use on this task, we developed a set of probabilistic agent-based behavioral models, including exploitative and explorative Bayesian agents, as well as heuristic control agents. Upon validating the model and parameter recovery properties of our model set and summarizing the participants’ choice data in a descriptive way, we used a maximum likelihood approach to evaluate the participants’ choice data from the perspective of our model set. In brief, we provide quantitative evidence that participants employ a belief state-based hybrid explorative-exploitative strategy on the information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task, lending further support to the finding that humans are guided by their subjective uncertainty when solving exploration-exploitation dilemmas.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jad.2013.06.032},
	abstract = {Background and aims: In the past decade, a large body of research has demonstrated that internet-based interventions can have beneﬁcial effects on depression. However, only a few clinical trials have compared internet-based depression therapy with an equivalent face-to-face treatment. The primary aim of this study was to compare treatment outcomes of an internet-based intervention with a face-to-face intervention for depression in a randomized non-inferiority trial.
Method: A total of 62 participants suffering from depression were randomly assigned to the therapistsupported internet-based intervention group (n¼ 32) and to the face-to-face intervention (n¼30). The 8 week interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles. Patients in both groups received the same treatment modules in the same chronological order and time-frame. Primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); secondary outcome variables were suicidal ideation, anxiety, hopelessness and automatic thoughts.
Results: The intention-to-treat analysis yielded no signiﬁcant between-group difference (online vs. face-to-face group) for any of the pre- to post-treatment measurements. At post-treatment both treatment conditions revealed signiﬁcant symptom changes compared to before the intervention. Within group effect sizes for depression in the online group (d¼1.27) and the face–to-face group (d¼1.37) can be considered large. At 3-month follow-up, results in the online group remained stable. In contrast to this, participants in the face-toface group showed signiﬁcantly worsened depressive symptoms three months after termination of treatment (t¼ À 2.05, df¼19, po.05). Limitations: Due to the small sample size, it will be important to evaluate these outcomes in adequatelypowered trials.
Conclusions: This study shows that an internet-based intervention for depression is equally beneﬁcial to regular face-to-face therapy. However, more long term efﬁcacy, indicated by continued symptom reduction three months after treatment, could be only be found for the online group.},

	abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology.},

	abstract = {Although expectancy effects induced by placebo treatment are reported to attenuate depressive symptoms in the long run, mechanisms underlying situational dynamics are not well understood. Improved reward learning has been discussed as a candidate mediator for effects of positive expectancies on more positive mood. Here, we fitted a series of Q-learning models to measure the effect of sham antidepressant treatment vs. openlabel placebo in a probabilistic reinforcement learning task. Treatment effects were observed mainly in those Q-learning models justified by the task structure. Additionally, interindividual variability remained the largest origin of unexplained variance in predictive match across models. These findings provide further support for the role of expectancies in reward learning. They also highlight the need for unraveling individual differences in cognitive mechanisms that account for differences in reward learning, and obtaining reliable estimates for them.},

	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a ﬁtted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efﬁcient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models ﬁt with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

We take the idea of stacking from the point estimation literature and generalize to the combination of predictive distributions. We extend the utility function to any proper scoring rule and use Pareto smoothed importance sampling to eﬃciently compute the required leave-one-out posterior distributions. We compare stacking of predictive distributions to several alternatives: stacking of means, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), Pseudo-BMA, and a variant of Pseudo-BMA that is stabilized using the Bayesian bootstrap. Based on simulations and real-data applications, we recommend stacking of predictive distributions, with bootstrapped-Pseudo-BMA as an approximate alternative when computation cost is an issue.},
